--- abstract

The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol {{MLSPROTO}} document has
the role of defining a Group Key Agreement, all the necessary
cryptographic operations, and serialization/deserialization functions
necessary to create a scalable and secure group messaging protocol.
The MLS protocol is meant to protect against eavesdropping, tampering,
message forgery, and provide good properties such as forward-secrecy
(FS) and post-compromise security (PCS) in the case of past or future
device compromises.

This document, on the other hand is intended to describe a general
secure group messaging infrastructure and its security goals.  It
provides guidance on building a group messaging system and discusses
security and privacy tradeoffs offered by multiple security mechanism
that are part of the MLS protocol (ie. frequency of public encryption
key rotation).

The document also extends the guidance to parts of the infrastructure
that are not standardized by the MLS Protocol document and left to the
application or the infrastructure architects to design.

While the recommendations of this document are not mandatory to follow
in order to interoperate at the protocol level, most will vastly
influence the overall security guarantees that are achieved by the
overall messaging system. This is especially true in case of active
adversaries that are able to compromise clients, the delivery service
or the authentication service.

# Introduction

RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH

The source for this draft is maintained in GitHub.  Suggested changes should
be submitted as pull requests at https://github.com/mlswg/mls-architecture.
Instructions are on that page as well.  Editorial changes can be
managed in GitHub, but any substantive change should be discussed on
the MLS mailing list.

DISCLAIMER: A lot of work is still ongoing on the current version of
this draft. Especially, this preliminary writing of the security
considerations has not been reviewed by the working group yet and
might contain errors.
Please file an issue on the document's GitHub if you find errors.

[[TODO: Remove disclaimer.]]

End-to-end security is a requirement for instant messaging systems and
is commonly deployed in many such systems. In this context,
"end-to-end" captures the notion that users of the system enjoy some
level of security -- with the precise level depending on the system
design -- even when the service provider they are using performs
unsatisfactorily.

Messaging Layer Security (MLS) specifies an architecture (this
document) and an abstract protocol {{MLSPROTO}} for providing
end-to-end security in this setting. MLS is not intended as a full
instant messaging protocol but rather is intended to be embedded in
concrete protocols, such as XMPP {{?RFC6120}}. In addition, it does not
specify a complete wire encoding, but rather a set of abstract data
structures which can then be mapped onto a variety of concrete
encodings, such as TLS {{?RFC8446}}, CBOR {{?RFC7049}}, and
JSON {{?RFC7159}}.  Implementations which adopt compatible encodings
will have some degree of interoperability at the message level, though
they may have incompatible identity/authentication infrastructures.
The MLS protocol has been designed to provide the same security
guarantees to all users, for all group sizes, even when it reduces to
only two users.

# General Setting

Informally, a group is a set of users who possibly use multiple
endpoint devices to interact with the Service Provider (SP).
A group may be as small as two members (the simple case of person to
person messaging) or as large as thousands.

In order to communicate securely, users initially interact with
services at their disposal to establish the necessary values and
credentials required for encryption and authentication.

The Service Provider presents two abstract functionalities that allow
clients to prepare for sending and receiving messages securely:

- An Authentication Service (AS) functionality which is responsible
  for maintaining a binding between a unique identifier (identity) and
  the public key material (credential) used for authentication in the
  MLS protocol. This functionality must also be able to generate these
  credentials or validate them if they are provided by MLS clients.

- A Delivery Service (DS) functionality which can receive and
  redistributing messages between group members. In the case of group
  messaging, the delivery service may also be responsible for acting
  as a "broadcaster" where the sender sends a single message which is
  then forwarded to each recipient in the group by the DS. The DS is
  also responsible for storing and delivering initial public key
  material required by MLS clients in order to proceed with the group
  secret key establishment that is part of the MLS protocol.

For convenience, this document adopts the representation of these
services being standalone servers, however the MLS protocol design is
made so that it is not necessarily the case.

It is important to note that the Authentication Service functionality
can be completely abstract in the case of a Service Provider which
allows MLS clients to generate, redistribute and validate their
credentials themselves.

Similarly to the AS, the Delivery Service can be completely abstract
if users are able to distribute credentials and messages without
relying on a central Delivery Service. Note, though, that the MLS
protocol requires group operation messages to be processed in-order by
all MLS clients.

In some sense, a set of MLS clients which can achieve the AS and DS
functionalities without relying on an external party do not need a
Service Provider.

                          ************************************
~~~~

In many systems, the AS and the DS are actually operated by the same
entity and may even be the same server. However, they are logically
distinct and, in other systems, may be operated by different entities.
Other partitions are also possible, such as having a separate
directory functionality or service.

According to this architecture design, a typical group messaging
scenario might look like this:

1. Alice, Bob and Charlie create accounts with a service
   provider and obtain credentials from the AS.

2. Alice, Bob and Charlie authenticate to the DS and store
   some initial keying material which can be used to send encrypted
   messages to them for the first time. This keying material is
   authenticated with their long term credentials.

3. When Alice wants to send a message to Bob and Charlie, she
   contacts the DS and looks up their initial keying material.
   She uses these keys to establish a new set of keys which she can
   use to send encrypted messages to Bob and Charlie. She then sends
   the encrypted message(s) to the DS, which forwards them to the
   recipients.

4. Bob and/or Charlie respond to Alice's message. In addition, they
   might choose to update their key material which provides
   post-compromise security {{fs-and-pcs}}. As a consequence of that
   change, the group secrets are updated

Clients may wish to do the following:

 -  create a group by inviting a set of other clients;

 -  add one or more clients to an existing group;

 -  remove one or more members from an existing group;

 -  update their own key material

 -  join an existing group;

 -  leave a group;

 -  send a message to everyone in the group;

 -  receive a message from someone in the group.

At the cryptographic level, clients (and by extension members in
groups) have equal permissions. For instance, any member can add
or remove another client in a group. This is in contrast to some
designs in which there is a single group controller who can modify the
group. MLS is compatible with having group administration restricted
to certain users, but we assume that those restrictions are enforced
by authentication and access control at the application layer.

Thus, for instance, while the MLS protocol allows for any existing
member of a group to add a new client, applications which use MLS
might enforce additional restrictions for which only a subset of
members can qualify, and thus will handle enforcing group policies
(such as determining if a user is allowed to add new users to the
group) at the application level.

## Group, Members and Clients

While informally, a group can be considered to be a set of users
possibly using multiple endpoint devices to interact with the
Service Provider, this definition is too simplistic.

Formally, a Client is a set of cryptographic objects composed by
public values such as a name (an identity), a public encryption key
and a public signature key. Ownership of a Client by a user is
determined by the fact that the user has knowledge of the
associated secret values. When a Client is part of a Group, it is
called a Member and its signature key pair uniquely defines its
identity to other clients or members in the Group.
In some messaging systems, clients belonging to the same user must
all share the same identity key pair, but MLS does not assume this.

Users will typically own multiple Clients, potentially one or more per
end-user devices (phones, web clients or other devices...) and may
choose to authenticate using the same signature key across devices,
using one signature key per device or even one signature key per group.

The formal definition of a Group in MLS is the set of clients that
have knowledge of the shared group secret established in the group key
establishment phase of the protocol and have contributed to it.
Until a Member has contributed to the group secret, other members
cannot assume they are a member of the group.

## Authentication Service

The Authentication Service (AS) has to provide two functionalities:

1. authenticate the Credentials (i.e. the identity/signature keypair)
   used in a group
2. authenticate messages sent in groups given the signature over the
   message and the sending member's Credential

The AS is considered an abstract layer by the MLS specification, part
of this service could be, for instance, running on the members'
devices, while another part is a separate entity entirely.

By the nature of its roles in MLS authentication, the AS is invested
with a large amount of trust and the compromise of one of its
functionalities could allow an adversary to, among other things,
impersonate group members. We discuss security considerations
regarding the compromise of the different AS functionalities in detail
in Section {{as-compromise}}.

### Credential Authentication

In many cases, the first functionality might be provided by a service
which fulfills a role similar to a certification authority in the
WebPKI: It provides a binding of an identity (e.g., a user name, phone
number, email address, etc) to a signature key. The identity/signature
key pair can then either be used directly in a group, or as an root of
trust which in turn authenticates credentials used in the group.

The flexibility afforded by the latter option allows for multiple
infrastructure considerations and has the benefit of providing ways to
use different signature keys across different groups by using
hierarchical authentication keys. This flexibility also comes at the
price of a security tradeoff, described in the security
considerations, between potential unlinkability of the signature keys
across groups and the amount of time required to reinstate
authentication and secrecy of messages after the compromise of a
device.

### Message Authentication

MLS messages are authenticated by a signature conforming to the
signature scheme of the group's ciphersuite. To allow for deniability
(see Section {{Non-Repudiation-vs-Deniability}}), messages do not
necessarily have to be signed by the private key corresponding to a
member's credential but the key has to be authenticated using some
mechanism.

While Credential authentication can be performed by a separate entity,
message authentication should be performed by each member separately
due to the encryption layer of the protocol which protects the
signature of the message.

## Delivery Service

The Delivery Service (DS) is expected to play multiple roles in the
Service Provider architecture:

* To act as a directory service providing the initial keying material
  for clients to use.
  This allows a client to establish a shared key and send encrypted
  messages to other clients even if the other client is offline.

* To route messages between clients and to act as a message
  broadcaster, taking in one message and forwarding it to multiple
  clients (also known as "server side fanout").

Because the MLS protocol provides a way for Clients to send and receive
application messages asynchronously, it only provides causal
ordering of application messages from senders while it has to enforce
global ordering of group operations to provide Group Agreement.

Depending on the level of trust given by the group to the Delivery
Service, the functional and privacy guarantees provided by MLS may
differ but the Authentication and Confidentiality guarantees remain
the same.

Unlike the Authentication Service which is trusted for authentication
and secrecy, the Delivery Service is completely untrusted regarding
this property. While privacy of group membership might be a problem
in the case of a DS server fanout, the Delivery Service can be
considered as an active adaptative network attacker from the point of
view of the security analysis.

### Key Storage

Upon joining the system, each client stores its initial cryptographic
key material with the Delivery Service. This key material, called
KeyPackage, advertises the functional abilities of the Client such as
supported protocol versions and extensions and the following
cryptographic information:

* A credential from the Authentication Service attesting to the
  binding between the identity and the client's signature key.

* The client's asymmetric encryption public key material signed with
  the signature public key associated with the credential.

As noted above, users may own multiple clients, each with their
own keying material, and thus there may be multiple entries
stored by each user.

The Delivery Service is also responsible for allowing users to add,
remove or update their initial keying material and to ensure
that the identifier for these keys are unique across all keys
stored on the DS.

### Key Retrieval

When a client wishes to establish a group, it first contacts the DS to
request a KeyPackage for each other client, authenticate it using
the signature keys, and then can use those to form the group.

### Delivery of messages and attachments {#delivery-guarantees}

The main responsibility of the Delivery Service is to ensure delivery
of messages. Specifically, we assume that DSs provide:

* Reliable delivery: when a message is provided to the DS,
  it is eventually delivered to all clients.

* In-order delivery: messages are delivered to the group
  in the order they are received by the Delivery Service
  and in approximately the order in which they are sent
  by clients. The latter is an approximate guarantee because
  multiple clients may send messages at the same time
  and so the DS needs some latitude in enforcing ordering
  across clients.

* Consistent ordering: the DS must ensure that all clients
  have the same view of message ordering for cryptographically
  relevant operations. This means that the DS MUST enforce
  global consistency of the ordering of group operation messages.

Note that the protocol provides three important information
within an MLSCiphertext message in order to provide ordering:

* The Group Identifier (GID) to allow to distinguish the group for
  which the message has been sent;

* The Epoch number, which represent the number of changes (version) of
  the group associated with a specific GID, and allows for
  lexicographical ordering of two messages from the same group;

* The Content Type of the message, which allows the DS to determine
  the ordering requirement on the message.

The MLS protocol itself can verify these properties. For instance, if
the DS reorders messages from a Client or provides different Clients
with inconsistent orderings, then Clients can detect this
misconduct. However, the protocol relies on the ordering, and on the
fact that only one honest group operation message is fanned-out to
clients per Epoch, to provide Clients with a consistent view of the
evolving Group State.

Note that some forms of DS misbehavior are still possible and
difficult to detect. For instance, a DS can simply refuse
to relay messages to and from a given client. Without some
sort of side information, other clients cannot generally
distinguish this form of Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

### Membership knowledge

Group membership is itself sensitive information and MLS is designed
to drastically limit the amount of persisted metadata. However, large
groups often require an infrastructure which provides server fanout.
In the case of client fanout, the destinations of a message is known by
all clients, hence the server usually does not need this information.
However, they may learn this information through traffic analysis.
Unfortunately, in a server side fanout model, the DS can learn that a given
client is sending the same message to a set of other clients. In
addition, there may be applications of MLS in which the group
membership list is stored on some server associated with the DS.

While this knowledge is not a break of authentication or
confidentiality, it is a serious issue for privacy. In the case where
metadata has to be persisted for functionality, it SHOULD be stored
encrypted at rest.

### Membership and offline members

Because Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS) rely
on the active deletion and replacement of keying material, any client
which is persistently offline may still be holding old keying material
and thus be a threat to both FS and PCS if it is later compromised.

MLS cannot inherently defend against this problem, especially in the
case where the Client hasn't processed messages but MLS-using
systems can enforce some mechanism to try retaining these properties.
Typically this will consist of evicting clients which are idle for too
long, thus containing the threat of compromise. The precise details of
such mechanisms are a matter of local policy and beyond the scope of
this document.

## Functional Requirements

MLS is designed as a large scale group messaging protocol and hence
aims to provide performance and safety to its users.  Messaging
systems that implement MLS provide support for conversations involving
two or more members, and aim to scale to groups as large as 50,000 members,
typically including many users using multiple devices.


### Membership Changes

MLS aims to provide agreement on group membership, meaning that all
group members have agreed on the list of current group members.

Some applications may wish to enforce ACLs to limit addition or
removal of group members, to privileged clients or users. Others may
wish to require authorization from the current group members or a
subset thereof.  Regardless, MLS does not allow addition or removal of
group members without informing all other members.

Once a client is part of a group, the set of devices controlled by the
user can only be altered by an authorized member of the group.
This authorization could depend on the application: some applications
might want to allow certain other members of the group to add or
remove devices on behalf of another member, while other applications
might want a more strict policy and allow only the owner of the
devices to add or remove them at the potential cost of weaker PCS
guarantees.

Members who are removed from a group do not enjoy special privileges:
compromise of a removed group member does not affect the security
of messages sent after their removal but might affect previous messages
if the group secrets have not been deleted properly.

### Parallel Groups

Any user may have membership in several Groups simultaneously.
The set of members of any group may or may not form a subset of the
members of another group. MLS guarantees that the FS and PCS goals are
maintained and not weakened by user membership in multiple groups.

### Security of Attachments

The security properties expected for attachments in the MLS protocol
are very similar to the ones expected from messages. The distinction
between messages and attachments stems from the fact that the typical
average time between the download of a message and the one from the
attachments may be different. For many reasons (a typical reason being
the lack of high bandwidth network connectivity), the lifetime of the
cryptographic keys for attachments is usually higher than for
messages, hence slightly weakening the PCS guarantees for attachments.

### Asynchronous Usage

No operation in MLS requires two distinct clients or members to be
online simultaneously. In particular, members participating in
conversations protected using MLS can update shared keys, add or
remove new members, and send messages and attachments without waiting
for another user's reply.

Messaging systems that implement MLS have to provide a transport layer
for delivering messages asynchronously and reliably.

### Access Control

The MLS protocol allows each member of the messaging group to perform
operations equally. This is because all clients within a group
(members) have access to the shared cryptographic material. However
every service/infrastructure have control over policies applied to
their own clients. Applications managing MLS clients can be configured
to allow for specific Group operations. An application can, for
example, decide to provide specific permissions to a group
administrator that will be the one to perform add and remove
operations, but the flexibility is immense here. On the other hand, in
many settings such as open discussion forums, joining can be allowed
for anyone.

The MLS protocol can in certain modes can exchange unencrypted group
operation messages. This flexibility is to allow services to perform
access control tasks on behalf of the group.

While the Application messages will always be encrypted, having the
handshake messages in plaintext has inconveniences in terms of privacy
as someone could collect the signatures on the handshake messages and
use it for tracking.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Prefer using encrypted group operation messages to avoid privacy
> issues related to non-encrypted signatures.

Note that in the default case of encrypted handshake messages, the
application level must make sure that the access control policies are
consistent across all clients to make sure that they remain in sync.
If two different policies were applied, the clients might not accept
or reject a group operation and end-up in different cryptographic
states, breaking their ability to communicate.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Avoid using inconsistent access control policies in the case of
> encrypted group operations.

### Recovery After State Loss

Conversation participants whose local MLS state is lost or corrupted
can reinitialize their state and continue participating in the
conversation.

[[OPEN ISSUE: The previous statement seems too strong, establish
what exact functional requirement we have regarding state recovery.
Previously: "This may entail some level of message loss, but
does not result in permanent exclusion from the group."]]

### Support for Multiple Devices

It is typically expected for users within a Group to own different
devices.

A new device can be added to a group and be considered as a new client
by the protocol. This client will not gain access to the history even
if it is owned by someone who owns another member of the Group.
Restoring history is typically not allowed at the protocol level but
applications can elect to provide such a mechanism outside of MLS.
Such mechanisms, if used, may undermine the FS and PCS guarantees
provided by MLS.

### Extensibility / Pluggability

Messages that do not affect the group state can carry an arbitrary
payload with the purpose of sharing that payload between group
members. No assumptions are made about the format of the payload.

### Federation

The protocol aims to be compatible with federated environments. While
this document does not specify all necessary mechanisms required for
federation, multiple MLS implementations can interoperate to form
federated systems if they use compatible authentication mechanisms
and infrastructure functionalities.

### Compatibility with future versions of MLS

It is important that multiple versions of MLS be able to coexist in
the future.  Thus, MLS offers a version negotiation mechanism; this
mechanism prevents version downgrade attacks where an attacker would
actively rewrite messages with a lower protocol version than the ones
originally offered by the endpoints. When multiple versions of MLS are
available, the negotiation protocol guarantees that the version agreed
upon will be the highest version supported in common by the group.

In MLS 1.0, the creator of the group is responsible for selecting the
best ciphersuite proposed across clients. Each client is able to
verify availability of protocol version, ciphersuites and extensions
at all times once he has at least received the first group operation
message.


# Security and Privacy Considerations

MLS adopts the Internet threat model {{?RFC3552}} and therefore
assumes that the attacker has complete control of the network. It is
intended to provide the security services described in the face of
such attackers.

-- The attacker can monitor the entire network

-- The attacker can read unprotected messages

-- The attacker can generate and inject any message in the unprotected
   transport layer.

In addition, these guarantees are intended to degrade gracefully in
the presence of compromise of the transport security links as well as
of both Clients and elements of the messaging system, as described in
the remainder of this section.

Generally, MLS is designed under the assumption that the transport
layer is present to protect metadata and privacy in general, while the
MLS protocol is providing stronger guarantees such as confidentiality,
integrity and authentication guarantees. Stronger properties such as
deniability can also be achieved in specific architecture designs.

## Assumptions on Transport Security Links

Any secure channel can be used as a transport layer to protect MLS
messages such as QUIC, TLS, WireGuard or TOR. Though the MLS protocol
is designed to consider the following threat-model:

-- The attacker can read and write arbitrary messages inside the
   secure transport channel.

This departs from most threat models where we consider that the secure
channel used for transport always provides secrecy. The reason for
this consideration is that in the group setting active malicious
insiders or adversarial services are be considered.

### Metadata protection for unencrypted group operations

The main use of the secure transport layer for MLS is to protect
the already limited amount of metadata. Very little information is
contained in the unencrypted header of the MLS Protocol message
format for group operation messages, and application messages are
always encrypted in MLS.

Contrary to popular messaging services, the full list of recipients
cannot be sent to the server for dispatching messages because that
list is potentially extremely large in MLS. So, the metadata typically
consists of a pseudo-random Group Identifier (GID), an numerical
index referring to the key needed to decrypt the ciphertext content and
another numerical value to determine the epoch of the group (the
number of group operations that have been performed).

MLS protocol provides an authenticated "Authenticated Additional
Data" field for application to make data available outside the
MLSCiphertext.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Use the "Authenticated Additional Data" field of the MLSCiphertext
> message instead of using other unauthenticated means of sending
> metadata throughout the infrastructure. If the data is private, the
> infrastructure should use encrypted Application messages instead.

Even though, some of these metadata information are not secret
payloads, in correlation with other data, a network observer might be
able to reconstruct sensitive information. Using a secure channel to
transfer this information will prevent a network attacker to access
this MLS protocol metadata if it cannot compromise the secure channel.

More importantly, there is one specific case where having no secure
channel to exchange the MLS messages can have a serious impact on
privacy. In the case of unencrypted group operation messages,
observing the signatures of the Group Operation messages may lead an
adversary to extract information about the group memberships.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Never use the unencrypted mode for group operations without using a
> secure channel for the transport layer.

### DoS protection

In general we do not consider Denial of Service (DoS) resistance to be
the responsibility of the protocol. However, it should not be possible
for anyone aside from the DS to perform a trivial DoS attack from
which it is hard to recover. This can be achieved through the secure
transport layer.

In the centralized setting DoS protection can typically be performed
by using tickets or cookies which identify users to a service for a
certain number of connections. Such a system helps preventing
anonymous clients to send arbitrary numbers of Group Operation
messages to the Delivery Service or the MLS clients.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Anonymous credentials can be used in order to help DoS attacks
> prevention, in a privacy preserving manner. Note that the privacy of
> these mechanisms has to be adjusted in accordance with the privacy
> expected from the secure transport links. (See more discussion
> further down.)

### Message suppression and error correction

The MLS protocol is particularly sensitive about Group Operation
message loss and reordering. This is because in the default setting,
MLS clients have to process those specific messages in order to have a
synchronized group state, after what the MLS protocol efficiently
generates keys for application messages.

The Delivery Service can have the role of helping with reliability,
but is mainly useful for reliability in the asynchronous aspect of the
communication between MLS clients.

While it is difficult or impossible to prevent a network adversary to
suppress payloads in transit, in certain infrastructures such as banks
or governments settings, unidirectional transports can be used and be
enforced via electronic or physical devices such as diodes. This can
lead to payload corruption which does not affect the security or
privacy properties of the MLS Protocol but does affect the reliability
of the service. In that case specific measures can be taken to ensure
the appropriate level of redundancy and quality of service for MLS.

## Intended Security Guarantees

### Message Secrecy and Authentication {#message-secrecy-authentication}

The trust establishment step of the MLS protocol is followed by a
conversation protection step where encryption is used by clients to
transmit authenticated messages to other clients through the DS.
This ensures that the DS does not have access to the group's private
content.

MLS aims to provide secrecy, integrity and authentication for all
messages.

Message Secrecy in the context of MLS means that only intended
recipients (current group members), can read any message sent to the
group, even in the context of an active attacker as described in the
threat model.

Message Integrity and Authentication mean that an honest Client can
only accept a message if it was sent by a group member and that no
Client can send a message which other Clients accept as being from
another Client.

A corollary to this statement is that the AS and the DS cannot read
the content of messages sent between Members as they are not Members
of the Group. MLS optionally provides additional protections regarding
traffic analysis so as to reduce the ability of attackers, or a
compromised member of the messaging system, to deduce the content of
the messages depending on (for example) their size. One of these
protections includes padding messages in order to produce ciphertexts
of standard length. While this protection is highly recommended it is
not mandatory as it can be costly in terms of performance for clients
and the SP.

Message content can be deniable if the signature keys are exchanged
over a deniable channel prior to signing messages.

### Forward and Post-Compromise Security {#fs-and-pcs}

MLS provides additional protection regarding secrecy of past messages
and future messages. These cryptographic security properties are
Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS).

FS means that access to all encrypted traffic history combined with an
access to all current keying material on clients will not defeat the
secrecy properties of messages older than the oldest key of the
compromised client.
Note that this means that clients have the extremely important role of
deleting appropriate keys as soon as they have been used with the
expected message, otherwise the secrecy of the messages and the
security for MLS is considerably weakened.

PCS means that if a group member's state is compromised at some time t
but the group member subsequently performs an update at some time t',
then all MLS guarantees apply to messages sent by the member after
time t', and by other members after they have processed the
update. For example, if an attacker learns all secrets known to Alice
at time t, including both Alice's long-term secret keys and all shared
group keys, but Alice performs a key update at time t', then the
attacker is unable to violate any of the MLS security properties after
the updates have been processed.

Both of these properties are satisfied even against compromised
DSs and ASs.

### Non-Repudiation vs Deniability {#Non-Repudiation-vs-Deniability}

MLS provides strong authentication within a group, such that a group member
cannot send a message that appears to be from another group member.
Additionally, some services require that a recipient be able to prove to the
service provider that a message was sent by a given client, in order to report
abuse. MLS supports both of these use cases. In some deployments, these services
are provided by mechanisms which allow the receiver to prove a message's origin
to a third party (this if often called "non-repudiation"), but it should also be
possible to operate MLS in a "deniable" mode where such proof is not possible.

## Endpoint Compromise

The MLS protocol adopts a threat model which includes multiple forms
of endpoint/client compromise. While adversaries are in a very strong position
if they have compromised an MLS client, there are still situations
where security guarantees can be recovered thanks to the PCS
properties achieved by the MLS protocol.

In this section we will explore the consequences and recommendations
regarding the following compromise scenarios:

-- The attacker has access to a specific symmetric encryption key

-- The attacker has access to the group secrets for one group

-- The attacker has access to a signature oracle for any group

-- The attacker has access to the signature key for one group

-- The attacker has access to all secrets of a user for all groups
   (full state compromise)

[[TODO: Cite the research papers in the context of these compromise models]]

Recall that the MLS protocol provides chains of AEAD keys, per sender
that are generated from Group Secrets. These keys are used to protect
MLS Plaintext messages which can be Group Operation or Application
messages. The Group Operation messages offer an additional protection
as the secret exchanged within the TreeKEM group key agreement are
public-key encrypted to subgroups with HPKE.

### Compromise of AEAD key material

In some circumstances, adversaries may have access to specific AEAD
keys and nonces which protect an Application or a Group Operation
message. While this is a very weak kind of compromise, it can be
realistic in cases of implementation vulnerabilities where only part
of the memory leaks to the adversary.

When an AEAD key is compromised, the adversary has access to a set of
AEAD keys for the same chain and the same epoch, hence can decrypt
messages sent using keys of this chain. An adversary cannot send a
message to a group which appears to be from any valid client since
they cannot forge the signature.

The MLS protocol will ensure that an adversary cannot compute any
previous AEAD keys for the same epoch, or any other epochs.  Because
of its Forward Secrecy guarantees, MLS will also retain secrecy of all
other AEAD keys generated for *other* MLS clients, outside this
dedicated chain of AEAD keys and nonces, even within the epoch of the
compromise. However the MLS protocol does not provide Post Compromise
Secrecy for AEAD encryption within an epoch. This means that if the
AEAD key of a chain is compromised, the adversary can compute an
arbitrary number of subsequent AEAD keys for that chain.

These guarantees are ensured by the structure of the MLS key schedule
which provides Forward Secrecy for these AEAD encryptions, across the
messages within the epoch and also across previous epochs.  Those
chains are completely disjoint and compromising keys across the
chains would mean that some Group Secrets have been compromised, which
is not the case in this attack scenario (we explore stronger
compromise scenarios as part of the following sections).

MLS provides Post-Compromise Secrecy against an active adaptative
attacker across epochs for AEAD encryption, which means that as soon
as the epoch is changed, if the attacker does not have access to more
secret material they won't be able to access any protected messages
from future epochs.

In the case of an Application message, an AEAD key compromise means
that the encrypted application message will be leaked as well as the
signature over that message. This means, that the compromise has both
confidentiality and privacy implications on the future AEAD
encryptions of that chain.
In the case of a Group Operation message, only the privacy is
affected, as the signature is revealed, because the secrets themselves
are protected by HPKE encryption.

Note that under that compromise scenario, authentication is not
affected in neither of these cases.  As every member of the group can
compute the AEAD keys for all the chains (they have access to the
Group Secrets) in order to send and receive messages, the
authentication provided by the AEAD encryption layer of the common
framing mechanism is very weak. Successful decryption of an AEAD
encrypted message only guarantees that a member of the group sent the
message.

### Compromise of the Group Secrets of a single group for one or more group epochs

The attack scenario considering an adversary gaining access to a set
of Group secrets is significantly stronger. This can typically be the
case when a member of the group is compromised.
For this scenario, we consider that the signature keys are not
compromised. This can be the case for instance if the adversary has
access to part of the memory containing the group secrets but not to
the signature keys which might be stored in a secure enclave.

In this scenario, the adversary gains the ability to compute any
number of AEAD encryption keys for any AEAD chains and can encrypt and
decrypt all messages for the compromised epochs.

If the adversary is passive, it is expected from the PCS properties of
the MLS protocol that, as soon as an honest Commit message is sent by
the compromised party, the next epochs will provide message secrecy.

If the adversary is active, the adversary can follow the protocol and
perform updates on behalf of the compromised party with no ability to
an honest group to recover message secrecy. However, MLS provides PCS
against active adaptative attackers through its Remove group
operation. This means that, as long as other members of the group are
honest, the protocol will guarantee message secrecy for all messages
exchanged in the epochs after the compromised party has been removed.

### Compromise by an active adversary with the ability to sign messages

Under such a scenario, where an active adversary has compromised an
MLS client, two different settings emerge. In the strongest compromise
scenario, the attacker has access to the signing key and can forge
authenticated messages. In a weaker, yet realistic scenario, the
attacker has compromised a client but the client signature keys are
protected with dedicated hardware features which do not allow direct
access to the value of the private key and instead provide a signature
API.

When considering an active adaptative attacker with access to a
signature oracle, the compromise scenario implies a significant
impact on both the secrecy and authentication guarantees of the
protocol, especially if the attacker also has access to the group
secrets. In that case both secrecy and authentication are broken.
The attacker can generate any message, for the current and future
epochs until an honest update from the compromised client happens.

Note that under this compromise scenario, the attacker can perform all
operations which are available to an legitimate client even without
access to the actual value of the signature key.

Without access to the group secrets, the adversary will not have the
ability to generate messages which look valid to other members of the
group and to the infrastructure as they need to have access to group
secrets to compute the encryption keys or the membership tag.

### Compromise of the authentication with access to a signature key

DISCLAIMER: Significant work remains in this section.
[[TODO: Remove disclaimer.]]

The difference between having access to the value of the signature key
and only having access to a signing oracle is not about the ability of
an active adaptative network attacker to perform different operations
during the time of the compromise, the attacker can perform every
operations available to a legitimate client in both cases.

There is a significant difference, however in terms of recovery after
a compromise.

Because of the PCS guarantees provided by the MLS protocol, when a
previously compromised client performs an honest Commit which is not
under the control of the adversary, both secrecy and authentication of
messages can be recovered in the case where the attacker didn't get
access to the key. Because the adversary doesn't have the key and has
lost the ability to sign messages, they cannot authenticate messages
on behalf of the compromised party, even if they still have control
over some group keys by colluding with other members of the group.

This is in contrast with the case where the signature key is leaked.
In that case PCS of the MLS protocol will eventually allow recovery of
the authentication of messages for future epochs but only after
compromised parties refresh their credentials securely.

Beware that in both oracle and private key access, an active
adaptative attacker, can follow the protocol and request to update its
own credential. This in turn induce a signature key rotation which
could provide the attacker with part or the full value of the private
key depending on the architecture of the service provider.

> Signature private keys should be compartmentalized from other
> secrets and preferably protected by an HSM or dedicated hardware
> features to allow recovery of the authentication for future messages
> after a compromised.

Even if the dedicated hardware approach is used, ideally, neither the
Client or the Authentication service alone should provide the
signature private key. Both should contribute to the key and it should
be stored securely by the client with no direct access.

### Security consideration in the context of a full state compromise

In real-world compromise scenarios, it is often the case that
adversaries target specific devices to obtain parts of the memory or
even the ability to execute arbitrary code in the targeted device.

Also, recall that in this setting, the application will often retain
the unencrypted messages. If so, the adversary does not have to break
encryption at all to access sent and received messages. Messages may
also be send by using the application to instruct the protocol
implementation.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> If messages are stored on the device, they should be protected using
> encryption at rest, and the keys used should be stored
> securely using dedicated mechanisms on the device.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> If the threat model of the system is against an adversary which can
> access the messages on the device without even needing to attack
> MLS, the application should delete plaintext messages and
> ciphertexts immediately after encryption or decryption.

Even though, from the strict point of view of the security
formalization, a ciphertext is always public and will forever be,
there is no loss in trying to erase ciphertexts as much as possible.

Note that this document makes a clear distinction between the way
signature keys and other group shared secrets must be handled.
In particular, a large set of group secrets cannot necessarily assumed
to be protected by an HSM or secure enclave features. This is
especially true because these keys are extremely frequently used and
changed with each message received by a client.

However, the signature private keys are mostly used by clients to send
a message. They also are providing the strong authentication
guarantees to other clients, hence we consider that their protection
by additional security mechanism should be a priority.

Overall there is no way to detect or prevent these compromise, as
discussed in the previous sections, performing separation of the
application secret states can help recovery after compromise, this is
the case for signature keys but similar concern exists for the
encryption private key used in the TreeKEM Group Key Agreement.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> The secret keys used for public key encryption should be stored
> similarly to the way the signature keys are stored as key can be
> used to decrypt the group operation messages and contain the secret
> material used to compute all the group secrets.

Even if secure enclaves are not perfectly secure, or even completely
broken, adopting additional protections for these keys can ease
recovery of the secrecy and authentication guarantees after a
compromise where for instance, an attacker can sign messages without
having access to the key. In certain contexts, the rotation of
credentials might only be triggered by the AS through ACLs, hence be
outside of the capabilities of the attacker.

## Service Node Compromise

### General considerations

#### Privacy of the network connections

There are many scenarios leading to communication between the
application on a device and the Delivery Service or the Authentication
Service. In particular when:

- The application connects to the Authentication Service to generate
  or validate a new credential before distributing it.

- The application fetches credentials at the Delivery Service prior to
  creating a messaging group (one-to-one or more than two clients).

- The application fetches service provider information or messages on
  the Delivery Service.

- The application sends service provider information or messages to
  the Delivery Service.

In all these cases, the application will often connect to the device
via a secure transport which leaks information about the origin of the
request such as the IP address and depending on the protocol the MAC
address of the device.

Similar concerns exist in the peer-to-peer use cases of MLS.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> In the case where privacy or anonymity is important, using adequate
> protection such as TOR or a VPN can improve metadata protection.

More generally, using anonymous credential in an MLS based
architecture might not be enough to provide strong privacy or
anonymity properties.

### Delivery Service Compromise

MLS is intended to provide strong guarantees in the face of compromise
of the DS. Even a totally compromised DS should not be able to read
messages or inject messages that will be acceptable to legitimate
clients. It should also not be able to undetectably remove, reorder
or replay messages.

However, a DS can mount a variety of DoS attacks on the system,
including total DoS attacks (where it simply refuses to forward any
messages) and partial DoS attacks (where it refuses to forward
messages to and from specific clients).
As noted in {{delivery-guarantees}}, these attacks are only partially
detectable by clients without an out-of-band channel. Ultimately,
failure of the DS to provide reasonable service must be dealt with as
a customer service matter, not via technology.

Because the DS is responsible for providing the initial keying
material to clients, it can provide stale keys. This does not
inherently lead to compromise of the message stream, but does allow it
to attack forward security to a limited extent. This threat can be
mitigated by having initial keys expire.

#### Privacy of delivery and push notifications

An important mechanism that is often ignored from the privacy
considerations are the push-tokens. In many modern messaging
architectures, applications are using push notification mechanisms
typically provided by OS vendors. This is to make sure that when
messages are available at the Delivery Service (or by other mechanisms
if the DS is not a central server), the recipient application on a
device knows about it. Sometimes the push notification can contain the
application message itself which saves a round trip with the DS.

To "push" this information to the device, the service provider and the
OS infrastructures use unique per-device, per-application identifiers
called push-tokens. This means that the push notification provider and
the service provider have information on which devices receive
information and at which point in time.

Even though they can't necessarily access the content, which is
typically encrypted MLS messages, the service provider and the push
notification provider have to be trusted to avoid making correlation
on which devices are recipients of the same message.

For secure messaging systems, push notification are often sent
real-time as it is not acceptable to create artificial delays for
message retrieval.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> If real time notification are not necessary and that specific steps
> must be taken to improve privacy, one can delay notifications
> randomly across recipient devices using a mixnet or other
> techniques.

Note that it is quite easy for legal requests to ask the service
provider for the push-token associated to an identifier and perform a
second request to the company operating the push-notification system
to get information about the device, which is often linked with a real
identity via a cloud account, a credit card or other information.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> If stronger privacy guarantees are needed vis-a-vis of the push
> notification provider, the client can choose to periodically connect
> to the Delivery Service without the need of a dedicated push
> notification infrastructure.

### Authentication Service Compromise {#as-compromise}

The Authentication Service design is left to the infrastructure
designers. In most designs, a compromised AS is a serious matter, as
the AS can serve incorrect or attacker-provided identities to clients.

-- The attacker can link an identity to a credential

-- The attacker can generate new credentials

-- The attacker can sign new credentials

-- The attacker can publish or distribute credentials

Infrastructures that provide cryptographic material or credentials in
place of the MLS client (which is under the control of the user) have
often the ability to use the associated secrets to perform operations
on behalf of the user, which is unacceptable in many situations. Other
mechanisms can be used to prevent this issue, such as the service
blessing cryptographic material used by an MLS client.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Make clients submit signature public keys to the AS, this is usually
> better than the AS generating public key pairs because the AS
> cannot sign on behalf of the client. This is a benefit of a Public
> Key Infrastructure in the style of the Internet PKI.

An attacker that can generate or sign new credential may or may not
have access to the underlying cryptographic material necessary to
perform such operations. In that last case, it results in windows of
time for which all emitted credentials might be compromised.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Using HSMs to store the root signature keys to limit the ability of
> an adversary with no physical access to extract the top-level
> signature key.

#### Authentication compromise: Ghost users and impersonations

One thing for which the MLS Protocol is designed for is to make sure
that all clients know who is in the group at all times. This means
that - if all Members of the group and the Authentication Service are
honest - no other parties than the members of the current group can
read and write messages protected by the protocol for that Group.

Beware though, the link between the cryptographic identity of the
Client and the real identity of the User is important.
With some Authentication Service designs, a private or centralized
authority can be trusted to generate or validate signature keypairs
used in the MLS protocol. This is typically the case in some of the
biggest messaging infrastructures.

While this service is often very well protected from external
attackers, it might be the case that this service is compromised.
In such infrastructure, the AS could generate or validate a signature
keypair for an identity which is not the expected one. Because a user
can have many MLS clients running the MLS protocol, it possibly has
many signature keypairs for multiple devices.

In the case where an adversarial keypair is generated for a specific
identity, an infrastructure without any transparency mechanism or
out-of-band authentication mechanism could inject a malicious client
into a group by impersonating a user. This is especially the case in
large groups where the UI might not reflect all the changes back the
the users.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Make sure that MLS clients reflect all the membership changes to the
> users as they happen. If a choice has to be made because the number
> of notifications is too high, a public log should be maintained in
> the state of the device so that user can examine it.

While the ways to handle MLS credentials are not defined by the
protocol or the architecture documents, the MLS protocol has been
designed with a mechanism that can be used to provide out-of-band
authentication to users. The "authentication_secret" generated for
each user at each epoch of the group is a one-time, per client,
authentication secret which can be exchanged between users to prove
their identity to each other. This can be done for instance using a QR
code that can be scanned by the other parties.

Another way to improve the security for the users is to provide a
transparency mechanism which allows each user to check if credentials
used in groups have been published in the transparency log. Another
benefit of this mechanism is for revocation. The users of a group
could check for revoked keys (in case of compromise detection) using a
mechanism such as CRLite or some more advanced privacy preserving
technology.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Provide a Key Transparency and Out-of-Band authentication mechanisms
> to limit the impact of an Authentication Service compromise.

We note, again, that as described prior to that section, the
Authentication Service is facultative to design a working
infrastructure and can be replaced by many mechanisms such as
establishing prior one-to-one deniable channels, gossiping, or using
TOFU for credentials used by the MLS Protocol.

Another important consideration is the ease of redistributing new keys
on client compromise, which helps recovering security faster in
various cases.

#### Privacy of the Group Membership

Often, expectation from users is that the infrastructure will not
retain the ability to constantly map the user identity to signature
public keys of the MLS protocol. Some infrastructures will keep a
mapping between signature public keys of clients and user
identities. This can benefit an adversary that has compromised the AS
(or required access according to regulation) the ability of monitoring
unencrypted traffic and correlate the messages exchanged within the
same group.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Always use encrypted group operation messages to reduce issues
> related to privacy.

In certain cases, the adversary can access to specific bindings
between public keys and identities. If the signature keys are reused
across groups, the adversary can get more information about the
targeted user.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Do not use the same signature keypair across groups.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Separate the service binding the identities and the public keys from
> the service which generates or validates the credentials or
> cryptographic material of the Clients.


## Considerations for attacks outside of the threat model

Physical attacks on devices storing and executing MLS principals are
not considered in depth in the threat model of the MLS protocol.
While non-permanent, non-invasive attacks can sometime be equivalent
to software attacks, physical attacks are considered outside of the
MLS threat model.

Compromise scenarios, typically consist in a software adversary, which
can maintain active adaptative compromise and arbitrarily change the
behavior of the client or service.

On the other hand, security goals consider that honest clients will
always run the protocol according to its specification. This relies on
implementations of the protocol to securely implement the
specification, which remains non-trivial.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Additional steps should be taken to protect the device and the MLS
> clients from physical compromise. In such setting, HSMs and secure
> enclaves can be used to protect signature keys.
>
> More information will be available in the Server-Assist draft.
