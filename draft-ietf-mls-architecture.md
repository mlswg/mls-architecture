--- abstract

The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol (I-D.ietf-mls-protocol)
provides a Group Key Agreement protocol for messaging applications.
MLS is meant to protect against eavesdropping, tampering, message
forgery, and provide Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security
(PCS).

This document describes the architecture for using MLS in a general
secure group messaging infrastructure and defines the security goals
for MLS.  It provides guidance on building a group messaging system
and discusses security and privacy tradeoffs offered by multiple
security mechanisms that are part of the MLS protocol (e.g., frequency
of public encryption key rotation). The document also provides
guidance for parts of the infrastructure that are not standardized by
MLS and are instead left to the application.

While the recommendations of this document are not mandatory to follow in order
to interoperate at the protocol level, they affect the overall security
guarantees that are achieved by a messaging application. This is especially true
in the case of active adversaries that are able to compromise clients, the delivery
service, or the authentication service.

# Introduction

RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH

The source for this draft is maintained in GitHub.  Suggested changes should
be submitted as pull requests at https://github.com/mlswg/mls-architecture.
Instructions are on that page as well.  Editorial changes can be
managed in GitHub, but any substantive change should be discussed on
the MLS mailing list.

End-to-end security is a used in the vast majority of instant messaging systems,
and also deployed in systems for other purposes such as calling and conferencing.
In this context, "end-to-end" captures
the notion that users of the system enjoy some level of security -- with the
precise level depending on the system design -- even in the face of malicious
actions by the operator of the messaging system.

Messaging Layer Security (MLS) specifies an architecture (this document) and a
protocol {{!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol}} for providing end-to-end security in this
setting. MLS is not intended as a full instant messaging protocol but rather is
intended to be embedded in concrete protocols, such as XMPP {{?RFC6120}}.
Implementations of the MLS protocol will interoperate at the cryptographic
level, though they may have incompatibilities in terms of how protected messages
are delivered, contents of protected messages, and identity/authentication
infrastructures.
The MLS protocol has been designed to provide the same security guarantees to
all users, for all group sizes, including groups of only two clients.

# General Setting

MLS provides a way for _clients_ to form _groups_ within which they can
communicate securely.  For example, a set of users might use clients on their
phones or laptops to join a group and communicate with each other. A group may
be as small as two clients (e.g., for simple person to person messaging) or as
large as tens of thousands.  A client that is part of a group is a _member_ of that
group. A user might have multiple MLS clients associated with the
same identity, for instance if they have different devices.

MLS is designed to operate within the context of a messaging service, which
may be a single service provider, a federated system, or some kind of
peer-to-peer system. The service needs to provide two services that
facilitate client communication using MLS:

- An Authentication Service (AS) which is responsible for
  attesting to bindings between application-meaningful identifiers and the
  public key material used for authentication in the MLS protocol. The
  AS must also be able to generate credentials that encode these
  bindings and validate credentials provided by MLS clients.

- A Delivery Service (DS)  which can receive and distribute
  messages between group members. In the case of group messaging, the delivery
  service may also be responsible for acting as a "broadcaster" where the sender
  sends a single message which is then forwarded to each recipient in the group
  by the DS. The DS is also responsible for storing and delivering initial
  public key material required by MLS clients in order to proceed with the group
  secret key establishment that is part of the MLS protocol.

For presentation purposes, this document treats the AS and DS as conventional
network services, however MLS does not require a specific implementation
for the AS or DS. These services may reside on the same server or different
servers, they may be distributed between server and client components, and they
may even involve some action by users.  For example:

* Several secure messaging services today provide a centralized DS, and rely on
  manual comparison of clients' public keys as the AS.

* MLS clients connected to a peer-to-peer network could instantiate a
  decentralized DS by transmitting MLS messages over that network.

* In an MLS group using a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authentication,
  the AS would comprise the certificate issuance and validation processes,
  both of which involve logic inside MLS clients as well as various
  existing PKI roles (ex: Certification Authorities).

It is important to note that the Authentication Service can be
completely abstract in the case of a Service Provider which allows MLS
clients to generate, distribute, and validate credentials themselves.
As with the AS, the Delivery Service can be completely abstract if
users are able to distribute credentials and messages without relying
on a central Delivery Service (as in a peer-to-peer system).  Note,
though, that in such scenarios, clients will need to implement logic
that assures the delivery properties required of the DS (see
{{delivery-guarantees}}).

with three clients and one group, and clients 2 and 3 being
part of the group and client 1 not being part of any group.

                     <-------------------- Welcome (Charlie)     |
~~~
{: #fig-group-formation-example title="Group Formation Example"}

This process proceeds as follows.

## Step 1: Account Creation

Alice, Bob, and Charlie create accounts with a service provider and obtain
credentials from the AS. This is a one-time setup phase.

## Step 2: Initial Keying Material

Alice, Bob, and Charlie authenticate to the DS and store some initial
keying material which can be used to send encrypted messages to them
for the first time. This keying material is authenticated with their
long-term credentials. Although in principle this keying material
can be reused for multiple senders, in order to provide forward secrecy
it is better for this material to be regularly refreshed so that each
sender can use a new key.

## Step 3: Adding Bob go the Group

When Alice wants to create a group including Bob, she first uses the DS to look
up his initial keying material. She then generates two messages:

* A message to the entire group (which at this point is just her and Bob)
  that adds Bob to the group.

* A _Welcome_ message just to Bob encrypted with his initial keying material that
  includes the secret keying information necessary to join the group.

She sends both of these messages to the Delivery Services, which is responsible
for sending them to the appropriate people. Note that the security of MLS
does not depend on the DS forwarding the Welcome message only to Bob, as it
is encrypted for him; it is simply not necessary for other group members
to receive it.

## Step 4: Adding Charlie to the Group

If Alice then wants to add Charlie to the group, she follows a similar procedure
as with Bob: she first uses the DS to look
up his initial keying material and then generates two messages:

* A message to the entire group (consisting of her, Bob, and Charlie) adding
  Charlie to the group.

* A _Welcome_ message just to Charlie encrypted with his initial keying material that
  includes the secret keying information necessary to join the group.

At the completion of this process, we have a group with Alice, Bob, and Charlie,
which means that they share a single encryption key which can be used to
send messages or to key other protocols.

## Other Group Operations

Once the group has been created, clients can perform other actions,
such as:

 -  sending a message to everyone in the group

 -  receiving a message from someone in the group

 -  adding one or more clients to an existing group

 -  remove one or more members from an existing group

 -  updating their own key material

 -  leave a group (by asking to be removed)

Importantly, MLS does not itself enforce any access control on group
operations. For instance, any member of the group can send a message
to add a new member or to evict an existing member.
This is in contrast to some designs in which there is a single group
controller who can modify the group. MLS-using applications are
responsible for setting their own access control policies. For instance,
if only the group administrator is allowed to change group members,
then it is the responsibility of the application to inform members
of this policy and who the administrator is.

## Users, Clients, and Groups {#group-members}

While it's natural to think of a messaging system as consisting of groups
of users, possibly using different devices, in MLS the basic unit of
operation is not the user but rather the "client".
Formally, a client is a set of cryptographic objects composed of
public values such as a name (an identity), a public encryption key,
and a public signature key. As usual, a user demonstrates ownership of
the client by demonstrating knowledge of the associated secret
values.

In some messaging systems, clients belonging to the same user
must all share the same signature key pair, but MLS does not assume
this; instead a user may have multiple clients with the same identity
and different keys. In this case, each client will have its own
cryptographic state, and it is up to the application to determine
how to present this situation to users. For instance, it may render
messages to and from a given user identically regardless of which
client they are associated with, or may choose to distinguish them.

When a client is part of a Group, it is called a Member.  A group in
MLS is defined as the set of clients that have knowledge of the shared
group secret established in the group key establishment phase of the
protocol and have contributed to it.

Until a client has been added to the group and contributed to the group
secret in a manner verifiable by other members of the group, other members
cannot assume that the client is a member of the group.


# Authentication Service

The Authentication Service (AS) has to provide three functionalities:

1. Issue credentials to clients that attest to bindings between identities and
   signature key pairs

2. Enable a client to verify that a credential presented by another client is
   valid with respect to a reference identifier

3. Enable a group member to verify that a credential represents the same client
   as another credential

A member with a valid credential authenticates its MLS messages by signing them
with the private key corresponding to the public key bound by its credential.

The AS is considered an abstract layer by the MLS specification and part of this
service could be, for instance, running on the members' devices, while another
part is a separate entity entirely.  The following examples illustrate the
breadth of this concept:

* A PKI could be used as an AS {{?RFC5280}}.  The issuance function would be
  provided by the certificate authorities in the PKI, and the verification
  function would correspond to certificate verification by clients.

* Several current messaging applications rely on users verifying each other's
  key fingerprints for authentication.  In this scenario, the issuance function
  is simply the generation of a key pair (i.e., a credential is just an
  identifier and public key, with no information to assist in verification).
  The verification function is the application functionality that enables users
  to verify keys.

* In a system based on {{CONIKS}} end user Key Transparency (KT), the issuance
  function would correspond to the insertion of a key in a KT log under a user's
  identity. The verification function would correspond to verifying a key's
  inclusion in the log for a claimed identity, together with the KT log's
  mechanisms for a user to monitor and control which keys are associated with
  their identity.

By the nature of its roles in MLS authentication, the AS is invested with a
large amount of trust and the compromise of one of its functionalities could
allow an adversary to, among other things, impersonate group members. We discuss
security considerations regarding the compromise of the different AS
functionalities in detail in {{as-compromise}}.

The association between members' identities and signature keys is fairly
flexible in MLS.  As noted above, there is no requirement that all clients
belonging to a given user use the same key pair (in fact, such key reuse is
forbidden to ensure clients have independent cryptographic state).  A member can
also rotate the signature key they use within a group.  These mechanisms allow
clients to use different signature keys in different contexts and at different
points in time, providing unlinkability and post-compromise security benefits.
Some security trade-offs related to this flexibility are discussed in the
security considerations.

In many applications, there are multiple MLS clients that represent a single
entity, for example a human user with a mobile and desktop version of an
application. Often the same set of clients is represented in exactly the same
list of groups. In applications where this is the intended situation, other
clients can check that a user is consistently represented by the same set of
clients.  This would make it more difficult for a malicious AS to issue fake
credentials for a particular user because clients would expect the credential to
appear in all groups of which the user is a member. If a client credential does
not appear in all groups after some relatively short period of time, clients
have an indication that the credential might have been created without the
user's knowledge. Due to the asynchronous nature of MLS, however, there may be
transient inconsistencies in a user's client set, so correlating users' clients
across groups is more of a detection mechanism than a prevention mechanism.

# Delivery Service

The Delivery Service (DS) plays two major roles in MLS:

* As a directory service providing the initial keying material for
  clients to use. This allows a client to establish a shared key and send
  encrypted messages to other clients even if they're offline.

* Routing MLS messages among clients.

While MLS depends on correct behavior by the Authentication Service in
order to provide endpoint authentication and hence confidentiality of
the group key, these properties do not depend on correct behavior by
the DS; even a malicious DS cannot add itself to groups or recover
the group key. However, depending precisely on how MLS is used, the DS may
be able to determine group membership or prevent changes to the
group from taking place (e.g., by blocking group change messages).

## Key Storage and Retrieval

Upon joining the system, each client stores its initial cryptographic key
material with the Delivery Service. This key material, called a KeyPackage,
advertises the functional abilities of the client such as supported protocol
versions, supported extensions, and the following cryptographic information:

* A credential from the Authentication Service attesting to the binding between
  the identity and the client's signature key.

* The client's asymmetric encryption public key.

All the parameters in the KeyPackage are signed with the signature
private key corresponding to the credential.
As noted in {{group-members}}, users may own multiple clients, each
with their own keying material. Each KeyPackage is specific to an MLS version
and ciphersuite, but a client may want to offer support for multiple protocol
versions and ciphersuites. As such, there may be multiple KeyPackages stored by
each user for a mix of protocol versions, ciphersuites, and end-user devices.

When a client wishes to establish a group or add clients to a group, it first
contacts the Delivery Service to request KeyPackages for each other client,
authenticates the KeyPackages using the signature keys, includes the KeyPackages
in Add Proposals, encrypts the information needed to join the group
(the _GroupInfo_ object) with an ephemeral key, then separately encrypts the
ephemeral key with the `init_key` from each KeyPackage.
When a client requests a KeyPackage in order to add a user to a group, the
Delivery Service should provide the minimum number of KeyPackages necessary to
satisfy the request.  For example, if the request specifies the MLS version, the
DS might provide one KeyPackage per supported ciphersuite, even if it has
multiple such KeyPackages to enable the corresponding client to be added to
multiple groups before needing to upload more fresh KeyPackages.

In order to avoid replay attacks and provide forward secrecy for
messages sent using the initial keying material, KeyPackages are
intended to be used only once. The Delivery Service is responsible for
ensuring that each KeyPackage is only used to add its client to a
single group, with the possible exception of a "last resort"
KeyPackage that is specially designated by the client to be used
multiple times. Clients are responsible for providing new
KeyPackages as necessary in order to minimize the chance that
the "last resort" KeyPackage will be used.

## Delivery of Messages {#delivery-guarantees}

The main responsibility of the Delivery Service is to ensure delivery of
messages. Some MLS messages need only be delivered to specific clients (e.g., a
Welcome message initializing a new member's state), while others need to be
delivered to all the members of a group.  The Delivery Service may enable the
latter delivery pattern via unicast channels (sometimes known as "client
fanout"), broadcast channels ("server fanout"), or a mix of both.

For the most part, MLS does not require the Delivery Service to deliver messages
in any particular order. Applications can set policies that control their
tolerance for out-of-order messages (see {{operational-requirements}}), and
messages that arrive significantly out-of-order can be dropped without otherwise
affecting the protocol. There are two exceptions to this. First, Proposal
messages should all arrive before the Commit that references them.  Second,
because an MLS group has a linear history of epochs, the members of the group
must agree on the order in which changes are applied.  Concretely, the group
must agree on a single MLS Commit message that ends each epoch and begins the
next one.

In practice, there's a realistic risk of two members generating Commit messages
at the same time, based on the same counter, and both attempting to send them to
the group at the same time. The extent to which this is a problem, and the
appropriate solution, depends on the design of the Delivery Service. Per the CAP
theorem {{CAPBR}}, there are two general classes of distributed system that the
Delivery Service might fall into:

* Consistent and Partition-tolerant, or Strongly Consistent, systems can provide
  a globally consistent view of data but may stop working if there are network
  issues;
* Available and Partition-tolerant, or Eventually Consistent, systems continue
  working despite network issues but may return different views of data to
  different users.

Strategies for sequencing messages in strongly and eventually consistent systems
are described in the next two subsections.

However, note that a malicious Delivery Service could also reorder messages or
provide an inconsistent view to different users.  The "generation" counter in
MLS messages provides per-sender loss detection and ordering that cannot be
manipulated by the DS.  A mechanism for more robust protections is discussed in
{{?I-D.ietf-mls-extensions}}.  A DS can cause a partition in the group by
partitioning key exchange messages; this can be detected only by out-of-band
comparison (e.g., confirming that all clients have the same
`epoch_authenticator` value`).

Other forms of Delivery Service misbehavior are still possible that are not easy
to detect. For instance, a Delivery Service can simply refuse to relay messages
to and from a given client. Without some sort of side information, other clients
cannot generally detect this form of Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

### Strongly Consistent

With this approach, the Delivery Service ensures that some types of incoming
messages have a linear order and all members agree on that order.  The Delivery
Service is trusted to break ties when two members send a Commit message at the
same time.

As an example, there could be an "ordering server" Delivery Service that
broadcasts all messages received to all users and ensures that all clients see
handshake messages in the same order. Clients that send a Commit would then wait
to apply it until it's broadcast back to them by the Delivery Service, assuming
they don't receive another Commit first.

The Delivery Service can rely on the `epoch` and `content_type` fields of an
MLSMessage for providing an order only to handshake messages, and possibly even
filter or reject redundant Commit messages proactively to prevent them from
being broadcast. Alternatively, the Delivery Service could simply apply an order
to all messages and rely on clients to ignore redundant Commits.

### Eventually Consistent

With this approach, the Delivery Service is built in a way that may be
significantly more available or performant than a strongly consistent system,
but offers weaker consistency guarantees. Messages may arrive to different
clients in different orders and with varying amounts of latency, which means
clients are responsible for reconciliation.

This type of Delivery Service might arise, for example, when group members are
sending each message to each other member individually, or when a distributed
peer-to-peer network is used to broadcast messages.

Upon receiving a Commit from the Delivery Service, clients can either:

1. Pause sending new messages for a short amount of time to account for a
   reasonable degree of network latency and see if any other Commits are
   received for the same epoch. If multiple Commits are received, the clients
   can use a deterministic tie-breaking policy to decide which to accept, and
   then resume sending messages as normal.

2. Accept the Commit immediately but keep a copy of the previous group state for
   a short period of time. If another Commit for a past epoch is received,
   clients use a deterministic tie-breaking policy to decide if they should
   continue using the Commit they originally accepted or revert and use the
   later one. Note that any copies of previous or forked group states must be
   deleted within a reasonable amount of time to ensure the protocol provides
   forward-secrecy.

In the event of a network partition, a subset of members may be isolated from
the rest of the group long enough that the mechanisms above no longer work. This
can only be solved by sending a ReInit proposal to both groups, possibly with an
external sender type, and recreating the group to contain all members again.

If the Commit references an unknown proposal, group members may need to solicit
the Delivery Service or other group members individually for the contents of the
proposal.

# Functional Requirements

MLS is designed as a large-scale group messaging protocol and hence aims to
provide both performance and security (e.g. integrity and confidentiality)
to its users. Messaging systems that implement MLS provide support for
conversations involving two or more members, and aim to scale to groups with
tens of thousands of members, typically including many users using multiple devices.

## Membership Changes

MLS aims to provide agreement on group membership, meaning that all group
members have agreed on the list of current group members.

Some applications may wish to enforce ACLs to limit addition or removal of group
members, to privileged clients or users. Others may wish to require
authorization from the current group members or a subset thereof.  Such policies
can be implemented at the application layer, on top of MLS. Regardless, MLS does
not allow for or support addition or removal of group members without informing
all other members.

Membership of an MLS group is managed at the level of individual clients.  In
most cases, a client corresponds to a specific device used by a user. If a user
has multiple devices, the user will be represented in a group by multiple
clients.  If an application wishes to implement operations at the level of
users, it is up to the application to track which clients belong to a given user
and ensure that they are added / removed consistently.

MLS provides two mechanisms for changing the membership of a group.  The primary
mechanism is for an authorized member of the group to send a Commit that adds or
removes other members.  The second mechanism is an "external join": A member of
the group publishes certain information about the group, which a new member can
use to construct an "external" Commit message that adds the new member to the
group.  (There is no similarly unilateral way for a member to leave the group;
they must be removed by a remaining member.)

With both mechanisms, changes to the membership are initiated from inside the
group.  When members perform changes directly, this is clearly the case.
External joins are authorized indirectly, in the sense that a member publishing
a GroupInfo object authorizes anyone to join who has access to the GroupInfo
object. Both types of joins are done via a Commit message, which could be
blocked by the DS or rejected by clients if the join is not authorized.  The
former approach requires that Commits be visible to the DS; the latter approach
requires that clients all share a consistent policy. In the unfortunate event
that an unauthorized member is able to join, MLS enables any member to remove
them.

Application setup may also determine other criteria for membership validity. For
example, per-device signature keys can be signed by an identity key recognized
by other participants. If a certificate chain is used to sign off on device
signature keys, then revocation by the owner adds an alternative flag to prompt
membership removal.

An MLS group's secrets change on every change of membership, so each client only
has access to the secrets used by the group while they are a member.  Messages
sent before a client joins or after they are removed are protected with keys
that are not accessible to the client.  Compromise of a member removed from a
group does not affect the security of messages sent after their removal.
Messages sent during the client's membership are also secure as long as the
client has properly implemented the MLS deletion schedule, which calls for the
secrets used to encrypt or decrypt a message to be deleted after use, along with
any secrets that could be used to derive them.

## Parallel Groups

Any user or client may have membership in several groups simultaneously.  The
set of members of any group may or may not form a subset of the members of
another group. MLS guarantees that the FS and PCS goals within a given group are
maintained and not weakened by user membership in multiple groups. However,
actions in other groups likewise do not strengthen the FS and PCS guarantees
within a given group, e.g. key updates within a given group following a device
compromise does not provide PCS healing in other groups; each group must be
updated separately to achieve internal goals.  This also applies to future
groups that a member has yet to join, that are likewise unaffected by updates
performed in current groups.

Applications may strengthen connectivity among parallel groups by requiring
periodic key updates from a user across all groups in which they have
membership.

Applications may use the PSK mechanism to link healing properties among parallel
groups.  For example, suppose a common member M of two groups A and B has
performed a key update in group A but not in group B.  The key update provides
PCS with regard to M in group A.  If a PSK is exported from group A and injected
into group B, then some of these PCS properties carry over to group B, since the
PSK and secrets derived from it are only known to the new, updated version of M,
not to the old, possibly compromised version of M.

## Asynchronous Usage

No operation in MLS requires two distinct clients or members to be online
simultaneously. In particular, members participating in conversations protected
using MLS can update the group's keys, add or remove new members, and send
messages without waiting for another user's reply.

Messaging systems that implement MLS have to provide a transport layer for
delivering messages asynchronously and reliably.

## Access Control

The MLS protocol allows each member of the messaging group to perform operations
equally. This is because all clients within a group (members) have access to the
shared cryptographic material. However, every service/infrastructure has control
over policies applied to its own clients. Applications managing MLS clients can
be configured to allow for specific group operations. On the one hand, an
application could decide that a group administrator will be the only member to
perform add and remove operations. On the other hand, in many settings such as
open discussion forums, joining can be allowed for anyone.

The MLS protocol can, in certain modes, exchange unencrypted group operation
messages. This flexibility is to allow services to perform access control tasks
on behalf of the group.

While the Application messages will always be encrypted, having the handshake
messages in plaintext has privacy consequences as someone could
collect the signatures on the handshake messages and use them for tracking.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Prefer using encrypted group operation messages to avoid
> privacy issues related to non-encrypted signatures.

Note that in the default case of encrypted handshake messages, any access
control policies will be applied at the client, so the application must ensure
that the access control policies are consistent across all clients to make sure
that they remain in sync.  If two different policies were applied, the clients
might not accept or reject a group operation and end-up in different
cryptographic states, breaking their ability to communicate.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Avoid using inconsistent access control policies in the
> case of encrypted group operations.

MLS allows actors outside the group to influence the group in two ways: External
signers can submit proposals for changes to the group, and new joiners can use
an external join to add themselves to the group.  The `external_senders`
extension ensures that all members agree on which signers are allowed to send
proposals, but any other policies must be assured to be consistent as above.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Have an explicit group policy setting the conditions under
> which external joins are allowed.

## Handling Authentication Failures

Within an MLS group, every member is authenticated to every other member by means of
credentials issued and verified by the Authentication Service.  MLS does not
prescribe what actions, if any, an application should take in the event that a
group member presents an invalid credential.  For example, an application may
require such a member to be immediately evicted, or may allow some grace period
for the problem to be remediated. To avoid operational problems, it is important
for all clients in a group to have a consistent view of which credentials in a
group are valid, and how to respond to invalid credentials.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Have a uniform credential validation process to ensure
> that all group members evaluate other members' credentials in the same way.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Have a uniform policy for how invalid credentials are
> handled.

In some authentication systems, it is possible for a previously-valid credential
to become invalid over time.  For example, in a system based on X.509
certificates, credentials can expire or be revoked.  The MLS update mechanisms
allow a client to replace an old credential with a new one. This is best done
before the old credential becomes invalid.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Proactively rotate credentials, especially if a credential
> is about to become invalid.

## Recovery After State Loss

Group members whose local MLS state is lost or corrupted can reinitialize their
state by re-joining the group as a new member and removing the member
representing their earlier state.  An application can require that a client
performing such a reinitialization prove its prior membership with a PSK.

There are a few practical challenges to this approach.  For example, the
application will need to ensure that all members have the required PSK,
including any new members that have joined the group since the epoch in which
the PSK was issued.  And of course, if the PSK is lost or corrupted along with
the member's other state, then it cannot be used to recover.

Reinitializing in this way does not provide the member with access to group
messages from during the state loss window, but enables proof of prior
membership in the group. Applications may choose various configurations for
providing lost messages to valid group members that are able to prove prior
membership.

## Support for Multiple Devices

It is typically expected for users within a group to own various devices. A new
device can be added to a group and be considered as a new client by the
protocol. This client will not gain access to the history even if it is owned by
someone who owns another member of the group.
Restoring history is typically not allowed at the protocol level but
applications can elect to provide such a mechanism outside of MLS.  Such
mechanisms, if used, may reduce the FS and PCS guarantees provided by MLS.

## Extensibility

The MLS protocol provides several extension points where additional information
can be provided.  Extensions to KeyPackages allow clients to disclose additional
information about their capabilities.  Groups can also have extension data
associated with them, and the group agreement properties of MLS will confirm
that all members of the group agree on the content of these extensions.

## Application Data Framing and Type Advertisements

Application messages carried by MLS are opaque to the protocol; they can contain
arbitrary data. Each application which uses MLS needs to define the format of
its `application_data` and any mechanism necessary to determine the format of
that content over the lifetime of an MLS group. In many applications this means
managing format migrations for groups with multiple members who may each be
offline at unpredictable times.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Use the default content mechanism defined in
> {{Section 2.3 of I-D.ietf-mls-extensions}}, unless the specific application defines another
> mechanism which more appropriately addresses the same requirements for that
> application of MLS.

The MLS framing for application messages also provides a field where clients can
send information that is authenticated but not encrypted.  Such information can
be used by servers that handle the message, but group members are assured that
it has not been tampered with.

## Federation

The protocol aims to be compatible with federated environments. While this
document does not specify all necessary mechanisms required for federation,
multiple MLS implementations can interoperate to form federated systems if they
use compatible authentication mechanisms, ciphersuites, application content, and
infrastructure functionalities. Federation is described in more detail in
{{?I-D.ietf-mls-federation}}.

## Compatibility with Future Versions of MLS

It is important that multiple versions of MLS be able to coexist in the
future. Thus, MLS offers a version negotiation mechanism; this mechanism
prevents version downgrade attacks where an attacker would actively rewrite
messages with a lower protocol version than the ones originally offered by the
endpoints. When multiple versions of MLS are available, the negotiation protocol
guarantees that the version agreed upon will be the highest version supported in
common by the group.

In MLS 1.0, the creator of the group is responsible for selecting the best
ciphersuite supported across clients. Each client is able to verify availability
of protocol version, ciphersuites and extensions at all times once he has at
least received the first group operation message.

Each member of an MLS group advertises the protocol functionality they support.
These capability advertisements can be updated over time, e.g., if client
software is updated while the client is a member of a group. Thus, in addition
to preventing downgrade attacks, the members of a group can also observe when it
is safe to upgrade to a new ciphersuite or protocol version.

# Operational Requirements

MLS is a security layer that needs to be integrated with an application. A
fully-functional deployment of MLS will have to make a number of decisions about
how MLS is configured and operated.  Deployments that wish to interoperate will
need to make compatible decisions. This section lists all of the dependencies of
an MLS deployment that are external to the protocol specification, but would
still need to be aligned within a given MLS deployment, or for two deployments
to potentially interoperate.

The protocol has a built-in ability to negotiate protocol versions,
ciphersuites, extensions, credential types, and additional proposal types. For
two deployments to interoperate, they must have overlapping support in each of
these categories. A `required_capabilities` extension can help maintain
interoperability with a wider set of clients by ensuring that certain
functionality continues to be supported by a group, even if the clients in the
group aren't currently relying on it.

MLS relies on the following network services. These network services would need
to be compatible in order for two different deployments based on them to
interoperate.

- An **Authentication Service**, described fully in {{authentication-service}},
  defines the types of credentials which may be used in a deployment and
  provides methods for:
  1. Issuing new credentials with a relevant credential lifetime,
  2. Validating a credential against a reference identifier,
  3. Validating whether or not two credentials represent the same client, and
  4. Optionally revoking credentials which are no longer authorized.

- A **Delivery Service**, described fully in {{delivery-service}}, provides
  methods for:
  1. Delivering messages for a group to all members in the group.
  2. Delivering Welcome messages to new members of a group.
  3. Uploading new KeyPackages for a user's own clients.
  4. Downloading KeyPackages for specific clients. Typically, KeyPackages are
     used once and consumed.

- Additional services may or may not be required depending on the application
  design:
  - If assisted joining is desired (meaning that the ratchet tree is not
    provided in Welcome messages), there must be a method to download the
    ratchet tree corresponding to a group.
  - If assisted joining is desired and the Delivery Service is not able to
    compute the ratchet tree itself (because some proposals or commits are sent
    encrypted), there must be a method for group members to publish the updated
    ratchet tree after each commit.
  - If external joiners are allowed, there must be a method to publish a
    serialized `GroupInfo` object (with an `external_pub` extension) that
    corresponds to a specific group and epoch, and keep that object in sync with
    the state of the group.
  - If an application chooses not to allow assisted or external joining, it may
    instead provide a method for external users to solicit group members (or a
    designated service) to add them to a group.
  - If the application uses external PSKs, or uses resumption PSKs that all
    members of a group may not have access to, there must be a method for
    distributing these PSKs to group members.
  - If an application wishes to detect and possibly discipline members that send
    malformed commits with the intention of corrupting a group's state, there
    must be a method for reporting and validating malformed commits.

MLS requires the following parameters to be defined, which must be the same for
two implementations to interoperate:

- The maximum total lifetime that is acceptable for a KeyPackage.

- How long to store the resumption secret for past epochs of a group.

- The degree of tolerance that's allowed for out-of-order message delivery:
  - How long to keep unused nonce and key pairs for a sender
  - A maximum number of unused key pairs to keep.
  - A maximum number of steps that clients will move a secret tree ratchet
    forward in response to a single message before rejecting it.
  - Whether to buffer messages that aren't able to be understood yet due to
    other messages not arriving first, and if so, how many and for how long. For
    example, Commit messages that arrive before a proposal they reference, or
    application messages that arrive before the Commit starting an epoch.

MLS provides the following locations where an application may store arbitrary
data. The format and intention of any data in these locations must align for two
deployments to interoperate:

- Application data, sent as the payload of an encrypted message.

- Additional authenticated data, sent unencrypted in an otherwise encrypted
  message.

- Group IDs, as decided by group creators and used to uniquely identify a group.

- The `application_id` extension of a LeafNode.

MLS requires the following policies to be defined, which restrict the set of
acceptable behavior in a group. These policies must be consistent between
deployments for them to interoperate:

- A policy on which ciphersuites are acceptable.

- A policy on any mandatory or forbidden MLS extensions.

- A policy on when to send proposals and commits in plaintext instead of
  encrypted.

- A policy for which proposals are valid to have in a commit, including but not
  limited to:
  - When a member is allowed to add or remove other members of the group.
  - When, and under what circumstances, a reinitialization proposal is allowed.
  - When proposals from external senders are allowed and how to authorize
    those proposals.
  - When external joiners are allowed and how to authorize those external
    commits.
  - Which other proposal types are allowed.

- A policy of when members should commit pending proposals in a group.

- A policy of how to protect and share the GroupInfo objects needed for
  external joins.

- A policy for when two credentials represent the same client. Note that many
  credentials may be issued authenticating the same identity but for different
  signature keys, because each credential corresponds to a different device
  (client) owned by the same application user. However, one device may control
  many signature keys but should still only be considered a single client.

- A policy on how long to allow a member to stay in a group without updating its
  leaf keys before removing them.

Finally, there are some additional application-defined behaviors that are
partially an individual application's decision but may overlap with
interoperability:

- If there's any policy on how or when to pad messages.

- If there is any policy for when to send a reinitialization proposal.

- How often clients should update their leaf keys.

- Whether to prefer sending full commits or partial/empty commits.

- Whether there should be a `required_capabilities` extension in groups.


# Security and Privacy Considerations

MLS adopts the Internet threat model {{?RFC3552}} and therefore assumes that the
attacker has complete control of the network. It is intended to provide the
security services described in the face of such attackers.

- The attacker can monitor the entire network.

- The attacker can read unprotected messages.

- The attacker can generate, inject and delete any message in the unprotected
  transport layer.

In addition, these guarantees are intended to degrade gracefully in the presence
of compromise of the transport security links as well as of both clients and
elements of the messaging system, as described in the remainder of this section.

Generally, MLS is designed under the assumption that the transport layer is
present to keep metadata private from network observers, while the MLS protocol provides confidentiality,
integrity, and authentication guarantees for the application data (which could pass
through multiple systems). Additional properties such as partial anonymity or deniability could also be
achieved in specific architecture designs.

## Assumptions on Transport Security Links

As discussed above, MLS provides the highest level of security when its messages
are delivered over an encrypted transport.  Any secure channel,
such as QUIC {{?RFC9000}}, TLS {{?RFC8446}}, can be used to
transport MLS messages.
However, the MLS protocol is designed to consider the following
threat-model:

- The attacker can read, write, and delete arbitrary messages inside the secure
  transport channel.

This departs from most threat models where we consider that the secure channel
used for transport always provides secrecy. The reason for this consideration is
that in the group setting, active malicious insiders or adversarial services are
to be considered.

The main use of the secure transport layer for MLS is to protect the already
limited amount of metadata. Very little information is contained in the
unencrypted header of the MLS protocol message format for group operation
messages, and application messages are always encrypted in MLS.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Use transports that provide reliability and metadata
> confidentiality whenever possible, e.g., by transmitting MLS messages over
> a protocol such as TLS {{?RFC8446}} or QUIC {{?RFC9000}}.

MLS avoids needing to send the full list of recipients to the server for
dispatching messages because that list could potentially contain tens of thousands of
recipients. Header metadata in MLS messages typically consists of an opaque
`group_id`, a numerical value to determine the epoch of the group (the number
of changes that have been made to the group), and whether the message is an
application message, a proposal, or a commit.

Even though some of this metadata information does not consist of sensitive
information, in correlation with other data a network observer might be able to
reconstruct sensitive information. Using a secure channel to transfer this
information will prevent a network attacker from accessing this MLS protocol
metadata if it cannot compromise the secure channel.

### Integrity and Authentication of Custom Metadata

The MLS protocol provides an authenticated "Additional Authenticated Data" field
for applications to make data available outside a PrivateMessage.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Use the "Additional Authenticated Data" field of the
> PrivateMessage instead of using other unauthenticated means of sending
> metadata throughout the infrastructure. If the data should be kept private, the
> infrastructure should use encrypted Application messages instead.

### Metadata Protection for Unencrypted Group Operations

Having no secure channel to exchange MLS messages can have a serious impact on
privacy when transmitting unencrypted group operation messages. Observing the
contents and signatures of the group operation messages may lead an adversary to
extract information about the group membership.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Never use the unencrypted mode for group operations
> without using a secure channel for the transport layer.

### DoS protection

In general we do not consider Denial of Service (DoS) resistance to be the
responsibility of the protocol. However, it should not be possible for anyone
aside from the Delivery Service to perform a trivial DoS attack from which it is
hard to recover. This can be achieved through the secure transport layer.

In the centralized setting, DoS protection can typically be performed by using
tickets or cookies which identify users to a service for a certain number of
connections. Such a system helps in preventing anonymous clients from sending
arbitrary numbers of group operation messages to the Delivery Service or the MLS
clients.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Use credentials uncorrellated with specific users to help prevent DoS
> attacks, in a privacy preserving manner. Note that the privacy of
> these mechanisms has to be adjusted in accordance with the privacy expected
> from secure transport links. (See more discussion in the next section.)

### Message Suppression and Error Correction

As noted above, MLS is designed to provide some robustness in the face of
tampering within the secure transport, i.e., tampering by the Delivery Service.
The confidentiality and authenticity properties of MLS prevent the DS from reading or
writing messages.  MLS also provides a few tools for detecting message
suppression, with the caveat that message suppression cannot always be
distinguished from transport failure.

Each encrypted MLS message carries a "generation" number which is a per-sender
incrementing counter.  If a group member observes a gap in the generation
sequence for a sender, then they know that they have missed a message from that
sender.  MLS also provides a facility for group members to send authenticated
acknowledgments of application messages received within a group.

As discussed in {{delivery-service}}, the Delivery Service is trusted to select
the single Commit message that is applied in each epoch from among the ones sent
by group members.  Since only one Commit per epoch is meaningful, it's not
useful for the DS to transmit multiple Commits to clients.  The risk remains
that the DS will use the ability maliciously.

While it is difficult or impossible to prevent a network adversary from
suppressing payloads in transit, in certain infrastructures such as banks or
governments settings, unidirectional transports can be used and be enforced via
electronic or physical devices such as diodes. This can lead to payload
corruption which does not affect the security or privacy properties of the MLS
protocol but does affect the reliability of the service. In that case specific
measures can be taken to ensure the appropriate level of redundancy and quality
of service for MLS.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** If unidirectional transport is used for the secure
> transport channel, prefer using a transport protocol which provides Forward
> Error Correction.

## Intended Security Guarantees

MLS aims to provide a number of security guarantees, covering authentication, as
well as confidentiality guarantees to different degrees in different scenarios.

### Message Secrecy and Authentication {#message-secrecy-authentication}

MLS enforces the encryption of application messages and thus generally
guarantees authentication and confidentiality of application messages sent in a
group.

In particular, this means that only other members of a given group can decrypt
the payload of a given application message, which includes information about the
sender of the message.

Similarly, group members receiving a message from another group member can
authenticate that group member as the sender of the message and verify the
message's integrity.

Message content can be deniable if the signature keys are exchanged over a
deniable channel prior to signing messages.

Depending on the group settings, handshake messages can be encrypted as well. If
that is the case, the same security guarantees apply.

MLS optionally allows the addition of padding to messages, mitigating the amount
of information leaked about the length of the plaintext to an observer on the
network.

### Forward and Post-Compromise Security {#fs-and-pcs}

MLS provides additional protection regarding secrecy of past messages and future
messages. These cryptographic security properties are Forward Secrecy (FS) and
Post-Compromise Security (PCS).

FS means that access to all encrypted traffic history combined with access to
all current keying material on clients will not defeat the secrecy properties of
messages older than the oldest key of the compromised client.  Note that this
means that clients have the extremely important role of deleting appropriate
keys as soon as they have been used with the expected message, otherwise the
secrecy of the messages and the security for MLS is considerably weakened.

PCS means that if a group member's state is compromised at some time t1 but the
group member subsequently performs an update at some time t2, then all MLS
guarantees apply to messages sent by the member after time t2, and by other
members after they have processed the update. For example, if an attacker learns
all secrets known to Alice at time t1, including both Alice's long-term secret
keys and all shared group keys, but Alice performs a key update at time t2, then
the attacker is unable to violate any of the MLS security properties after the
updates have been processed.

Both of these properties are satisfied even against compromised DSs and ASs.

Confidentiality is mainly ensured on the client side.  Because Forward Secrecy
(FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS) rely on the active deletion and
replacement of keying material, any client which is persistently offline may
still be holding old keying material and thus be a threat to both FS and PCS if
it is later compromised.

MLS partially defends against this problem by active members including
freshness, however not much can be done on the inactive side especially in the
case where the client has not processed messages.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Mandate key updates from clients that are not otherwise
> sending messages and evict clients which are idle for too long.

These recommendations will reduce the ability of idle compromised clients to
decrypt a potentially long set of messages that might have followed the point of
the compromise.

The precise details of such mechanisms are a matter of local policy and beyond
the scope of this document.

### Non-Repudiation vs Deniability {#Non-Repudiation-vs-Deniability}

MLS provides strong authentication within a group, such that a group member
cannot send a message that appears to be from another group member.
Additionally, some services require that a recipient be able to prove to the
service provider that a message was sent by a given client, in order to report
abuse. MLS supports both of these use cases. In some deployments, these services
are provided by mechanisms which allow the receiver to prove a message's origin
to a third party. This is often called "non-repudiation".

Roughly speaking, "deniability" is the opposite of "non-repudiation", i.e., the
property that it is impossible to prove to a third party that a message was sent
by a given sender.  MLS does not make any claims with regard to deniability.  It
may be possible to operate MLS in ways that provide certain deniability
properties, but defining the specific requirements and resulting notions of
deniability requires further analysis.

### Associating a User's Clients

When the same user uses multiple clients, it may be possible for other members
of a group to recognize all of those clients as belonging to the same user.  For
example, all of a user's clients might present credentials authenticating the
user's identity.  This association among devices might be considered a leak of
private information.  The remainder of this section describes several approaches
for addressing this.

This risk only arises when the leaf nodes for the clients in question provide
data that can be used to correlate the clients.  So one way to mitigate this
risk is by only doing client-level authentication within MLS. If user-level
authentication is still desirable, the application would have to provide it
through some other mechanism.

It is also possible to maintain user-level authentication while hiding
information about the clients that a user owns.  This can be done by having the
clients share cryptographic state, so that they appear as a single client within
the MLS group.  The application would need to provide a synchronization
mechanism so that the clients' state remained consistent across changes to the
MLS group.

## Endpoint Compromise

The MLS protocol adopts a threat model which includes multiple forms of
endpoint/client compromise. While adversaries are in a strong position if
they have compromised an MLS client, there are still situations where security
guarantees can be recovered thanks to the PCS properties achieved by the MLS
protocol.

In this section we will explore the consequences and recommendations regarding
the following compromise scenarios:

- The attacker has access to a specific symmetric encryption key

- The attacker has access to the group secrets for one group

- The attacker has access to a signature oracle for any group

- The attacker has access to the signature key for one group

- The attacker has access to all secrets of a user for all groups (full state
  compromise)

The MLS protocol provides per-sender chains of AEAD keys that are generated from
Group Secrets. These keys are used to protect MLS Plaintext messages which can
be Group Operation or Application messages. The Group Operation messages offer
an additional protection as the secret exchanged within the TreeKEM group key
agreement are public-key encrypted to subgroups with HPKE.

### Compromise of AEAD key material

In some circumstances, adversaries may have access to specific AEAD keys and
nonces which protect an Application or a Group Operation message. While this is
a limited kind of compromise, it can be realistic in cases of implementation
vulnerabilities where only part of the memory leaks to the adversary.

When an AEAD key is compromised, the adversary has access to a set of AEAD keys
for the same chain and the same epoch, hence can decrypt messages sent using
keys of this chain. An adversary cannot send a message to a group which appears
to be from any valid client since they cannot forge the signature.

The MLS protocol will ensure that an adversary cannot compute any previous AEAD
keys for the same epoch, or any other epochs.  Because of its Forward Secrecy
guarantees, MLS will also retain secrecy of all other AEAD keys generated for
*other* MLS clients, outside this dedicated chain of AEAD keys and nonces, even
within the epoch of the compromise. However the MLS protocol does not provide
Post Compromise Secrecy for AEAD encryption within an epoch. This means that if
the AEAD key of a chain is compromised, the adversary can compute an arbitrary
number of subsequent AEAD keys for that chain.

These guarantees are ensured by the structure of the MLS key schedule which
provides Forward Secrecy for these AEAD encryptions, across the messages within
the epoch and also across previous epochs.  Those chains are completely disjoint
and compromising keys across the chains would mean that some Group Secrets have
been compromised, which is not the case in this attack scenario (we explore
stronger compromise scenarios as part of the following sections).

MLS provides Post-Compromise Security against an active adaptive attacker across
epochs for AEAD encryption, which means that as soon as the epoch is changed, if
the attacker does not have access to more secret material they won't be able to
access any protected messages from future epochs.

In the case of an Application message, an AEAD key compromise means that the
encrypted application message will be leaked as well as the signature over that
message. This means that the compromise has both confidentiality and privacy
implications on the future AEAD encryptions of that chain.  In the case of a
Group Operation message, only the privacy is affected, as the signature is
revealed, because the secrets themselves are protected by HPKE encryption.

Note that under that compromise scenario, authentication is not affected in
either of these cases.  As every member of the group can compute the AEAD keys
for all the chains (they have access to the Group Secrets) in order to send and
receive messages, the authentication provided by the AEAD encryption layer of
the common framing mechanism is weak. Successful decryption of an AEAD
encrypted message only guarantees that a member of the group sent the message.

### Compromise of the Group Secrets of a single group for one or more group epochs

The attack scenario considering an adversary gaining access to a set of Group
secrets is significantly stronger. This can typically be the case when a member
of the group is compromised.  For this scenario, we consider that the signature
keys are not compromised. This can be the case for instance if the adversary has
access to part of the memory containing the group secrets but not to the
signature keys which might be stored in a secure enclave.

In this scenario, the adversary gains the ability to compute any number of AEAD
encryption keys for any AEAD chains and can encrypt and decrypt all messages for
the compromised epochs.

If the adversary is passive, it is expected from the PCS properties of the MLS
protocol that, as soon as the compromised party remediates the compromise and
sends an honest Commit message, the next epochs will provide message secrecy.

If the adversary is active, the adversary can follow the protocol and perform
updates on behalf of the compromised party with no ability for an honest group
to recover message secrecy. However, MLS provides PCS against active adaptive
attackers through its Remove group operation. This means that, as long as other
members of the group are honest, the protocol will guarantee message secrecy for
all messages exchanged in the epochs after the compromised party has been
removed.

### Compromise by an active adversary with the ability to sign messages

Under such a scenario, where an active adversary has compromised an MLS client,
two different settings emerge. In the strongest compromise scenario, the
attacker has access to the signing key and can forge authenticated messages. In
a weaker, yet realistic scenario, the attacker has compromised a client but the
client signature keys are protected with dedicated hardware features which do
not allow direct access to the value of the private key and instead provide a
signature API.

When considering an active adaptive attacker with access to a signature oracle,
the compromise scenario implies a significant impact on both the secrecy and
authentication guarantees of the protocol, especially if the attacker also has
access to the group secrets. In that case both secrecy and authentication are
broken.  The attacker can generate any message, for the current and future
epochs, until the compromise is remediated and the formerly compromised client
sends an honest update.

Note that under this compromise scenario, the attacker can perform all
operations which are available to a legitimate client even without access to the
actual value of the signature key.

Without access to the group secrets, the adversary will not have the ability to
generate messages which look valid to other members of the group and to the
infrastructure as they need to have access to group secrets to compute the
encryption keys or the membership tag.

### Compromise of the authentication with access to a signature key

The difference between having access to the value of the signature key and only
having access to a signing oracle is not about the ability of an active adaptive
network attacker to perform different operations during the time of the
compromise, the attacker can perform every operation available to a legitimate
client in both cases.

There is a significant difference, however in terms of recovery after a
compromise.

Because of the PCS guarantees provided by the MLS protocol, when a previously
compromised client performs an honest Commit which is not under the control of
the adversary, both secrecy and authentication of messages can be recovered in
the case where the attacker didn't get access to the key. Because the adversary
doesn't have the key and has lost the ability to sign messages, they cannot
authenticate messages on behalf of the compromised party, even if they still
have control over some group keys by colluding with other members of the group.

This is in contrast with the case where the signature key is leaked.  In that
case PCS of the MLS protocol will eventually allow recovery of the
authentication of messages for future epochs but only after compromised parties
refresh their credentials securely.

Beware that in both oracle and private key access, an active adaptive attacker
can follow the protocol and request to update its own credential. This in turn
induces a signature key rotation which could provide the attacker with part or
the full value of the private key depending on the architecture of the service
provider.

### Security consideration in the context of a full state compromise

In real-world compromise scenarios, it is often the case that adversaries target
specific devices to obtain parts of the memory or even the ability to execute
arbitrary code in the targeted device.

Also, recall that in this setting, the application will often retain the
unencrypted messages. If so, the adversary does not have to break encryption at
all to access sent and received messages. Messages may also be sent by using the
application to instruct the protocol implementation.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** If messages are stored on the device, they should be
> protected using encryption at rest, and the keys used should be stored
> securely using dedicated mechanisms on the device.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** If the threat model of the system is against an adversary
> which can access the messages on the device without even needing to attack
> MLS, the application should delete plaintext messages and ciphertexts
> as soon as practical after encryption or decryption.

Even though, from the strict point of view of the security formalization, a
ciphertext is always public and will forever be, there is no loss in trying to
erase ciphertexts as much as possible.

Note that this document makes a clear distinction between the way signature keys
and other group shared secrets must be handled.  In particular, a large set of
group secrets cannot necessarily be assumed to be protected by an HSM or secure
enclave features. This is especially true because these keys are
frequently used and changed with each message received by a client.

However, the signature private keys are mostly used by clients to send a
message. They also provide strong authentication guarantees to other clients,
hence we consider that their protection by additional security mechanisms should
be a priority.

Overall there is no way to detect or prevent these compromises, as discussed in
the previous sections, performing separation of the application secret states
can help recovery after compromise, this is the case for signature keys but
similar concern exists for the encryption private key used in the TreeKEM Group
Key Agreement.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** The secret keys used for public key encryption should be
> stored similarly to the way the signature keys are stored, as keys can be used

> to compute all the group secrets.

Even if secure enclaves are not perfectly secure, or even completely broken,
adopting additional protections for these keys can ease recovery of the secrecy
and authentication guarantees after a compromise where, for instance, an
attacker can sign messages without having access to the key. In certain
contexts, the rotation of credentials might only be triggered by the AS through
ACLs, hence be outside of the capabilities of the attacker.

## Service Node Compromise

### General considerations

#### Privacy of the network connections

There are many scenarios leading to communication between the application on a
device and the Delivery Service or the Authentication Service. In particular
when:

- The application connects to the Authentication Service to generate or validate
  a new credential before distributing it.

- The application fetches credentials at the Delivery Service prior to creating
  a messaging group (one-to-one or more than two clients).

- The application fetches service provider information or messages on the
  Delivery Service.

- The application sends service provider information or messages to the Delivery
  Service.

In all these cases, the application will often connect to the device via a
secure transport which leaks information about the origin of the request such as
the IP address and depending on the protocol the MAC address of the device.

Similar concerns exist in the peer-to-peer use cases of MLS.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** In the case where privacy or anonymity is important, using
> adequate protection such as TOR or a VPN can improve metadata protection.

More generally, using anonymous credentials in an MLS based architecture might
not be enough to provide strong privacy or anonymity properties.

### Delivery Service Compromise

MLS is intended to provide strong guarantees in the face of compromise of the
DS. Even a totally compromised DS should not be able to read messages or inject
messages that will be acceptable to legitimate clients. It should also not be
able to undetectably remove, reorder or replay messages.

However, a malicious DS can mount a variety of DoS attacks on the system,
including total DoS attacks (where it simply refuses to forward any messages)
and partial DoS attacks (where it refuses to forward messages to and from
specific clients).  As noted in {{delivery-guarantees}}, these attacks are only
partially detectable by clients without an out-of-band channel. Ultimately,
failure of the DS to provide reasonable service must be dealt with as a customer
service matter, not via technology.

Because the DS is responsible for providing the initial keying material to
clients, it can provide stale keys. This does not inherently lead to compromise
of the message stream, but does allow it to attack forward security to a limited
extent. This threat can be mitigated by having initial keys expire.

Initial keying material (KeyPackages) using the `basic` Credential type is more
vulnerable to replacement by a malicious or compromised DS, as there is no
built-in cryptographic binding between the identity and the public key of the
client.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Prefer a Credential type in KeyPackages which includes a
> strong cryptographic binding between the identity and its key (for example the
> `x509` Credential type). When using the `basic` Credential type take extra
> care to verify the identity (typically out-of-band).

#### Privacy of delivery and push notifications

An important mechanism that is often ignored from the privacy considerations are
the push-tokens. In many modern messaging architectures, applications are using
push notification mechanisms typically provided by OS vendors. This is to make
sure that when messages are available at the Delivery Service (or by other
mechanisms if the DS is not a central server), the recipient application on a
device knows about it. Sometimes the push notification can contain the
application message itself which saves a round trip with the DS.

To "push" this information to the device, the service provider and the OS
infrastructures use unique per-device, per-application identifiers called
push-tokens. This means that the push notification provider and the service
provider have information on which devices receive information and at which
point in time. Alternatively, non-mobile applications could use a websocket or
persistent connection for notifications directly from the DS.

Even though they can't necessarily access the content, which is typically
encrypted MLS messages, the service provider and the push notification provider
have to be trusted to avoid making correlation on which devices are recipients
of the same message.

For secure messaging systems, push notifications are often sent real-time as it
is not acceptable to create artificial delays for message retrieval.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** If real time notifications are not necessary, one can
> delay notifications randomly across recipient devices using a mixnet or other
> techniques.

Note that with a legal request to ask the service provider for
the push-token associated with an identifier, it is easy to correlate the token
with a second request to the
company operating the push-notification system to get information about the
device, which is often linked with a real identity via a cloud account, a credit
card or other information.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** If stronger privacy guarantees are needed with regard to
> the push notification provider, the client can choose to periodically connect
> to the Delivery Service without the need of a dedicated push notification
> infrastructure.

### Authentication Service Compromise {#as-compromise}

The Authentication Service design is left to the infrastructure designers. In
most designs, a compromised AS is a serious matter, as the AS can serve
incorrect or attacker-provided identities to clients.

- The attacker can link an identity to a credential

- The attacker can generate new credentials

- The attacker can sign new credentials

- The attacker can publish or distribute credentials

It is possible for a system to have a centralized server generate signature key
pairs and distribute them to clients. This is strongly discouraged. In such cases, the centralized server is
a point of compromise, since it stores signature private keys that can be used
to impersonate clients.  A better approach is instead to generate signature key
pairs in clients and have them "blessed" by the centralized service, e.g., by
having the service issue a credential binding the key pair to the client's
identity.  In this approach, there is still a risk that the centralized service
will authorize additional key pairs, but it will not be able to use existing,
client-generated private keys.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Make clients submit signature public keys to the AS, this
> is usually better than the AS generating public key pairs because the AS
> cannot sign on behalf of the client. This is a benefit of a Public Key
> Infrastructure in the style of the Internet PKI.

An attacker that can generate or sign new credentials may or may not have access
to the underlying cryptographic material necessary to perform such
operations. In that last case, it results in windows of time for which all
emitted credentials might be compromised.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Use HSMs to store the root signature keys to limit the
> ability of an adversary with no physical access to extract the top-level
> signature private key.

#### Authentication compromise: Ghost users and impersonations

One important feature of MLS is that all Members know which other members are in
the group at all times. If all Members of the group and the Authentication
Service are honest, no parties other than the members of the current group can
read and write messages protected by the protocol for that Group.

Details about how to verify the identity of a client depend on the MLS
Credential type used. For example, cryptographic verification of credentials can
be largely performed autonomously (e.g. without user interaction) by
the clients themselves for the `x509` Credential
type. In contrast, when MLS clients use the `basic` Credential type, a larger
degree of trust must be placed in a (likely) centralized authentication
resource, or on out-of-band processes such as manual verification.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Select the strongest MLS Credential type available among
> the target members of an MLS group.

If the AS is compromised, it could validate a (or generate a new) signature
keypair for an attacker. Because a user can have many MLS clients running the
MLS protocol, it possibly has many signature keypairs for multiple
devices. These attacks could be very difficult to detect.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Provide a key transparency mechanism for the
> Authentication Services to allow public verification of the credentials
> authenticated by this service.

Note that when a `basic` Credential is used, the Authentication Service also
needs an out-of-band mechanism to verify the identity asserted in the
Credential.

In the case where an adversarial keypair is generated for a specific identity,
an infrastructure without any transparency mechanism or out-of-band
authentication mechanism could inject a malicious client into a group by
impersonating a user. This is especially the case in large groups where the UI
might not reflect all the changes back to the users.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Make sure that MLS clients reflect all the membership
> changes to the users as they happen. If a choice has to be made because the
> number of notifications is too high, a public log should be maintained of the
> state of the device so that the user can examine it.

While the ways to handle MLS credentials are not defined by the protocol or the
architecture documents, the MLS protocol has been designed with a mechanism that
can be used to provide out-of-band authentication to users. The
"authentication_secret" generated for each user at each epoch of the group is a
one-time, per client, authentication secret which can be exchanged between users
to prove their identity to each other. This can be done for instance using a QR
code that can be scanned by the other parties.

Another way to improve the security for the users is to provide a transparency
mechanism which allows each user to check if credentials used in groups have
been published in the transparency log. Another benefit of this mechanism is for
revocation. The users of a group could check for revoked keys (in case of
compromise detection) using a mechanism such as CRLite or some more advanced
privacy preserving technology.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Provide one or more out-of-band authentication
> mechanisms to limit the impact of an Authentication Service compromise.

We note, again, that as described prior to that section, the Authentication
Service may not be a centralized system, and could be realized by many
mechanisms such as establishing prior one-to-one deniable channels, gossiping,
or using trust on first use (TOFU) for credentials used by the MLS Protocol.

Another important consideration is the ease of redistributing new keys on client
compromise, which helps recovering security faster in various cases.

#### Privacy of the Group Membership

Group membership is itself sensitive information and MLS is designed to limit
the amount of persistent metadata. However, large groups often require an
infrastructure which provides server fanout.  In the case of client fanout, the
destination of a message is known by all clients, hence the server usually does
not need this information.  However, they may learn this information through
traffic analysis.  Unfortunately, in a server-side fanout model, the Delivery
Service can learn that a given client is sending the same message to a set of
other clients. In addition, there may be applications of MLS in which the group
membership list is stored on some server associated with the Delivery Service.

While this knowledge is not a breach of the protocol's authentication or
confidentiality guarantees, it is a serious issue for privacy.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** In the case where metadata has to be persisted for
> functionality, it should be stored encrypted at rest and then decrypted during
> the execution. Applications should also consider anonymous systems for server
> fanout (for example {{Loopix}}).

Some infrastructure keeps a mapping between keys used in the MLS protocol and
user identities. An attacker with access to this information due to compromise
or regulation can associate unencrypted group messages (e.g., Commits and
Proposals) with the corresponding user identity.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Use encrypted group operation messages to limit
> privacy risks whenever possible.

In certain cases, the adversary can access specific bindings between public keys
and identities. If the signature keys are reused across groups, the adversary
can get more information about the targeted user.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Do not use the same signature keypair across
> groups. Update all keys for all groups on a regular basis. Do not preserve
> keys in different groups when suspecting a compromise.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Separate the service binding the identities and the public
> keys from the service which generates or validates the credentials or
> cryptographic material of the Clients.


## Considerations for attacks outside of the threat model

Physical attacks on devices storing and executing MLS principals are not
considered in depth in the threat model of the MLS protocol.  While
non-permanent, non-invasive attacks can sometimes be equivalent to software
attacks, physical attacks are considered outside of the MLS threat model.

Compromise scenarios typically consist of a software adversary, which can
maintain active adaptive compromise and arbitrarily change the behavior of the
client or service.

On the other hand, security goals consider that honest clients will always run
the protocol according to its specification. This relies on implementations of
the protocol to securely implement the specification, which remains non-trivial.

> **RECOMMENDATION:** Additional steps should be taken to protect the device and
> the MLS clients from physical compromise. In such settings, HSMs and secure
> enclaves can be used to protect signature keys.

## Cryptographic Analysis of the MLS Protocol

Various academic works have analyzed MLS and the different security guarantees
it aims to provide. The security of large parts of the protocol has been
analyzed by {{BBN19}} (draft 7), {{ACDT21}} (draft 11) and {{AJM20}} (draft 12).

Individual components of various drafts of the MLS protocol have been analyzed
in isolation and with differing adversarial models, for example, {{BBR18}},
{{ACDT19}}, {{ACCKKMPPWY19}}, {{AJM20}}, {{ACJM20}}, and {{AHKM21}} analyze the
ratcheting tree as the sub-protocol of MLS that facilitates key agreement,
{{WPBB22}} analyzes the sub-protocol of MLS for group state agreement and authentication,
while {{BCK21}} analyzes the key derivation paths in the ratchet tree and key
schedule. Finally, {{CHK21}} analyzes the authentication and cross-group healing
guarantees provided by MLS.
