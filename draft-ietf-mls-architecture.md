--- abstract

The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol {{!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol}} specification has
the role of defining a Group Key Agreement protocol, including all the
cryptographic operations and serialization/deserialization functions
necessary for scalable and secure group messaging.
The MLS protocol is meant to protect against eavesdropping, tampering,
message forgery, and provide further properties such as Forward Secrecy
(FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS) in the case of past or future
device compromises.

This document describes a general
secure group messaging infrastructure and its security goals.  It
provides guidance on building a group messaging system and discusses
security and privacy tradeoffs offered by multiple security mechanisms
that are part of the MLS protocol (e.g., frequency of public encryption
key rotation).

The document also provides guidance for parts of the infrastructure
that are not standardized by the MLS Protocol document and left to the
application or the infrastructure architects to design.

While the recommendations of this document are not mandatory to follow
in order to interoperate at the protocol level,
they affect the overall security guarantees that are achieved by a
messaging application. This is especially true in case of active
adversaries that are able to compromise clients, the delivery service,
or the authentication service.

# Introduction

RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH

The source for this draft is maintained in GitHub.  Suggested changes should
be submitted as pull requests at https://github.com/mlswg/mls-architecture.
Instructions are on that page as well.  Editorial changes can be
managed in GitHub, but any substantive change should be discussed on
the MLS mailing list.

End-to-end security is a requirement for instant messaging systems and
is commonly deployed in many such systems. In this context,
"end-to-end" captures the notion that users of the system enjoy some
level of security -- with the precise level depending on the system
design -- even in the face of malicious actions by the operator of the messaging
system.

Messaging Layer Security (MLS) specifies an architecture (this
document) and a protocol {{!I-D.ietf-mls-protocol}} for providing
end-to-end security in this setting. MLS is not intended as a full
instant messaging protocol but rather is intended to be embedded in
concrete protocols, such as XMPP {{?RFC6120}}.  Implementations of the MLS
protocol will interoperate at the cryptographic level, though
they may have incompatibilities in terms of how protected messages are
delivered, contents of protected messages, and identity/authentication infrastructures.
The MLS protocol has been designed to provide the same security
guarantees to all users, for all group sizes, even when it reduces to
only two users.

# General Setting

Informally, a group is a set of users who possibly use multiple
endpoint devices to interact with the Service Provider (SP).
A group may be as small as two members (the simple case of person to
person messaging) or as large as thousands.

In order to communicate securely, users initially interact with
services at their disposal to establish the necessary values and
credentials required for encryption and authentication.

The Service Provider presents two abstract functionalities that allow
clients to prepare for sending and receiving messages securely:

- An Authentication Service (AS) functionality which is responsible
  for attesting to bindings between application-meaningful identifiers and
  the public key material used for authentication in the
  MLS protocol. This functionality must also be able to generate
  credentials that encode these bindings and validate credentials provided by MLS clients.

- A Delivery Service (DS) functionality which can receive and
  distribute messages between group members. In the case of group
  messaging, the delivery service may also be responsible for acting
  as a "broadcaster" where the sender sends a single message which is
  then forwarded to each recipient in the group by the DS. The DS is
  also responsible for storing and delivering initial public key
  material required by MLS clients in order to proceed with the group
  secret key establishment that is part of the MLS protocol.

For convenience, this document adopts the representation of these
services being standalone servers, however the MLS protocol design is
made so that this is not necessarily the case.  These services may reside on the
same server or different servers, they may be distributed between server and
client components, and they may even involve some action by users.  For example:

* Several secure messaging services today provide a centralized DS, and
  rely on manual comparison of clients' public keys as the AS.

* MLS clients connected to a peer-to-peer network could instantiate a
  decentralized DS by transmitting MLS messages over that network.

* In an MLS group using a PKI for authentication, the AS would comprise the
  certificate issuance and validation processes, both of which involve logic
  inside MLS clients as well as various servers.

It is important to note that the Authentication Service functionality
can be completely abstract in the case of a Service Provider which
allows MLS clients to generate, distribute, and validate
credentials themselves.
As with the AS, the Delivery Service can be completely abstract
if users are able to distribute credentials and messages without
relying on a central Delivery Service.
Note, though, that in such scenarios, clients will need to implement logic that
assures the delivery properties required of the DS (see {{delivery-guarantees}}).

~~~

According to this architecture design, a typical group messaging
scenario might look like this:

1. Alice, Bob and Charlie create accounts with a service
   provider and obtain credentials from the AS.

2. Alice, Bob and Charlie authenticate to the DS and store
   some initial keying material which can be used to send encrypted
   messages to them for the first time. This keying material is
   authenticated with their long-term credentials.

3. When Alice wants to send a message to Bob and Charlie, she
   contacts the DS and looks up their initial keying material.
   She uses these keys to establish a new set of keys which she can
   use to send encrypted messages to Bob and Charlie. She then sends
   the encrypted message(s) to the DS, which forwards them to the
   recipients.

4. Bob and/or Charlie respond to Alice's message. In addition, they
   might choose to update their key material which provides
   post-compromise security (see {{fs-and-pcs}}). As a consequence of that
   change, the group secrets are updated.

Clients may wish to do the following:

 -  create a group by inviting a set of other clients;

 -  add one or more clients to an existing group;

 -  remove one or more members from an existing group;

 -  update their own key material

 -  join an existing group;

 -  leave a group;

 -  send a message to everyone in the group;

 -  receive a message from someone in the group.

At the cryptographic level, clients (and by extension members in
groups) have equal permissions. For instance, any member can add
or remove another client in a group. This is in contrast to some
designs in which there is a single group controller who can modify the
group. MLS is compatible with having group administration restricted
to certain users, but we assume that those restrictions are enforced
by the application layer.

## Group Members and Clients

While informally, a group can be considered to be a set of users
possibly using multiple endpoint devices to interact with the
Service Provider, this definition is too simplistic.

Formally, a client is a set of cryptographic objects composed of
public values such as a name (an identity), a public encryption key,
and a public signature key. Ownership of a client by a user is
determined by the fact that the user has knowledge of the
associated secret values. When a client is part of a Group, it is
called a Member.
In some messaging systems, clients belonging to the same user must
all share the same signature key pair, but MLS does not assume this.

Users will often use multiple devices, e.g., a phone as well as a laptop.
Different devices may be represented as different clients, with independent
cryptographic state.
The formal definition of a Group in MLS is the set of clients that
have knowledge of the shared group secret established in the group key
establishment phase of the protocol and have contributed to it.
Until a Member has been added to the group and contributed to the group
secret in a manner verifiable by other members of the group, other
members cannot assume that the Member is a member of the group.
Different devices are represented as different clients with independent
cryptographic state.

# Authentication Service

The Authentication Service (AS) has to provide three functionalities:

1. Issue credentials to clients that attest to bindings between identities and
   signature key pairs

2. Enable a client to verify that a credential presented by another client
   is valid with respect to a reference identifier

3. Enable a group member to verify that a credential represents the same
   application-level instance of an MLS user as another credential

A member with a valid credential authenticates its MLS messages by signing them
with the private key corresponding to the public key bound by its credential.

The AS is considered an abstract layer by the MLS specification and part
of this service could be, for instance, running on the members'
devices, while another part is a separate entity entirely.  The following
examples illustrate the breadth of this concept:

* A PKI could be used as an AS {{?RFC5280}}.  The issuance function would be
  provided by the certificate authorities in the PKI, and the verification
  function would correspond to certificate verification by clients.

* Several current messaging applications rely on users verifying each others'
  key fingerprints for authentication.  In this scenario, the issuance function
  is simply the generation of a key pair (i.e., a credential is just an identifier and
  public key, with no information to assist in verification).  The verification
  function is the application functionality that enables users to verify keys.

* In a system based on Key Transparency (KT) {{KeyTransparency}}, the issuance
  function would correspond to the insertion of a key in a KT log under a user's
  identity. The verification function would correspond to verifying a key's
  inclusion in the log for a claimed identity, together with the KT log's
  mechanisms for a user to monitor and control which keys are associated to
  their identity.

By the nature of its roles in MLS authentication, the AS is invested
with a large amount of trust and the compromise of one of its
functionalities could allow an adversary to, among other things,
impersonate group members. We discuss security considerations
regarding the compromise of the different AS functionalities in detail
in {{as-compromise}}.

The association between members' identities and signature keys is fairly
flexible in MLS.  As noted above, there is no requirement that all clients
belonging to a given user use the same key pair (in fact, such key reuse is
forbidden to ensure clients have independent cryptographic state).  A member can
also rotate the signature key they use within a group.  These mechanisms allow
clients to use different signature keys in different contexts and at different
points in time, providing unlinkability and post-compromise security benefits.
Some security trade-offs related to this flexibility are discussed in the
security considerations.

In many applications, there are multiple MLS clients that represent a single
entity, for example a human user with a mobile and desktop version of an
application. Often the same set of clients is represented in exactly the same
list of groups. In applications where this is the intended situation, other clients
can check that a user is consistently represented by the same set of clients.
This would make it more difficult for a malicious AS to issue fake credentials
for a particular user because clients would expect the credential to appear in
all groups of which the user is a member. If a client credential does not
appear in all groups after some relatively short period of time, clients have
an indication that the credential might have been created without the user's
knowledge. Due to the asynchronous nature of MLS, however, there may be
transient inconsistencies in a user's client set, so correlating users'
clients across groups is more of a detection mechanism than a prevention
mechanism.

# Delivery Service

The Delivery Service (DS) is expected to play multiple roles in the
Service Provider architecture:

* Acting as a directory service providing the initial keying material
  for clients to use.
  This allows a client to establish a shared key and send encrypted
  messages to other clients even if they're offline.

* Routing MLS messages among clients.

Depending on the level of trust given by the group to the Delivery
Service, the functional and privacy guarantees provided by MLS may
differ but the authentication and confidentiality guarantees remain
the same.

Unlike the Authentication Service which is trusted for authentication
and secrecy, the Delivery Service is completely untrusted regarding
this property. While privacy of group membership might be a problem
in the case of a Delivery Service server fanout, the Delivery Service can be
considered as an active, adaptive network attacker for the purpose of
security analysis.

## Key Storage and Retrieval

Upon joining the system, each client stores its initial cryptographic
key material with the Delivery Service. Clients then continue adding and
removing keying material on a regular basis. This key material, called a
KeyPackage, advertises the functional abilities of the client such as
supported protocol versions, supported extensions, and the following
cryptographic information:

* A credential from the Authentication Service attesting to the
  binding between the identity and the client's signature key.

* The client's asymmetric encryption public key.

All the parameters in the KeyPackage are signed with the signature private key
corresponding to the credential.

The Delivery Service is responsible for ensuring that each KeyPackage is only
served once, with the possible exception of a "last resort" KeyPackage that's
specially designated by the client to be used multiple times. As noted in the
previous section, users may own multiple clients, each with their own keying
material. Clients may also want to support multiple protocol versions and
ciphersuites. As such, there may be multiple entries stored by each user for a
mix of protocol versions, ciphersuites, and end-user devices. The Delivery
Service should provide the minimum number of KeyPackages necessary to satisfy a
request.

When a client wishes to establish a group, it first contacts the Delivery
Service to request a KeyPackage for each other client, authenticates the
KeyPackages using the signature keys, and then uses those to form
the group.

## Delivery of Messages {#delivery-guarantees}

The main responsibility of the Delivery Service is to ensure delivery of
messages. Some MLS messages need only be delivered to specific clients (e.g., a
Welcome message initializing a new member's state), while others need to be
delivered to all the members of a group.  The Delivery Service may enable the
latter delivery pattern via unicast channels (sometimes known as "client
fanout"), broadcast channels ("server fanout"), or a mix of both.

For the most part, MLS does not require the Delivery Service to deliver messages
in any particular order. Applications can set policies that control their
tolerance for out-of-order messages (see {{operational-requirements}}), and
messages that arrive significantly out-of-order can be dropped without
otherwise affecting the protocol. There are two exceptions to this. First,
Proposal messages should all arrive before the Commit that references them.
Second, because an MLS group has a linear history of epochs, the members of the
group must agree on the order in which
changes are applied.  Concretely, the group must agree on a single MLS Commit
message that ends each epoch and begins the next one.

In practice, there's a realistic risk of two members generating Commit messages
at the same time, based on the same counter, and both attempting to send them to
the group at the same time. The extent to which this is a problem, and the
appropriate solution, depends on the design of the Delivery Service. Per the CAP
theorem {{CAPBR}}, there are two general classes of distributed system that the Delivery
Service might fall into:

* Consistent and Partition-tolerant, or Strongly Consistent, systems can provide a globally
  consistent view of data but may stop working if there are network issues.
* Available and Partition-tolerant, or Eventually Consistent, systems continue working despite
  network issues but may return different views of data to different users.

Strategies for sequencing messages in strongly and eventually consistent systems are described in the
next two subsections.

However, note that a malicious Delivery Service could also reorder messages or provide an
inconsistent view to different users. The
protocol is designed such that this only results in a group no longer being
functional and the group members possibly detecting this and requesting
reinitialization.

Other forms of Delivery Service misbehavior are still possible that are not easy
to detect. For instance, a Delivery Service can simply refuse to relay messages
to and from a given client. Without some sort of side information, other clients
cannot generally detect this form of Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

### Strongly Consistent

With this approach, the Delivery Service ensures that some types of incoming
messages have a linear order and all members agree on that order.
The Delivery Service is trusted to break ties
when two members send a Commit message at the same time.

As an example, there could be an "ordering server" Delivery Service that
broadcasts all messages received to all users and ensures that all clients see
handshake messages in the same order. Clients that send a Commit would then
wait to apply it until it's broadcast back to them by the Delivery Service,
assuming they don't receive another Commit first.

The Delivery Service can rely on the `epoch` and `content_type` fields of an
MLSMessage for providing an order only to handshake messages, and possibly
even filter or reject redundant Commit messages proactively to prevent them from
being broadcast. Alternatively, the Delivery Service could simply apply an
order to all messages and rely on clients to ignore redundant
Commits.

### Eventually Consistent

With this approach, the Delivery Service is built in a way that may be
significantly more available or performant than a strongly consistent system, but offers weaker
consistency guarantees. Messages may arrive to different clients in different
orders and with varying amounts of latency, which means clients are responsible
for reconciliation.

This type of Delivery Service might arise, for example, when group members are
sending each message to each other member inidividually, or when a distributed
peer-to-peer network is used to broadcast messages.

Upon receiving a Commit from the Delivery Service, clients can either:

1. Pause sending new messages for a short amount of time to account for a
   reasonable degree of network latency and see if any other Commits are
   received for the same epoch. If multiple Commits are received, the clients
   can use a deterministic tie-breaking policy to decide which to accept, and
   then resume sending messages as normal.
2. Accept the Commit immediately but keep a copy of the previous group state for
   a short period of time. If another Commit for a past epoch is received,
   clients use a deterministic tie-breaking policy to decide if they should
   continue using the Commit they originally accepted or revert and use the
   later one. Note that any copies of previous or forked group states MUST be
   deleted within a reasonable amount of time to ensure the protocol provides
   forward-secrecy.

In the event of a network partition, a subset of members may be isolated from
the rest of the group long enough that the mechanisms above no longer work. This
can only be solved by sending a ReInit proposal to both groups, possibly with an
external sender type, and recreating the group to contain all members again.

If the Commit references an unknown proposal, group members may need to solicit
the Delivery Service or other group members inidividually for the contents of
the proposal.

# Functional Requirements

MLS is designed as a large-scale group messaging protocol and hence
aims to provide both performance and safety to its users.  Messaging
systems that implement MLS provide support for conversations involving
two or more members, and aim to scale to groups with tens of thousands of members,
typically including many users using multiple devices.

## Membership Changes

MLS aims to provide agreement on group membership, meaning that all
group members have agreed on the list of current group members.

Some applications may wish to enforce ACLs to limit addition or
removal of group members, to privileged clients or users. Others may
wish to require authorization from the current group members or a
subset thereof.  Such policies can be implemented at the application layer, on
top of MLS. Regardless, MLS does not allow for or support addition
or removal of group members without informing all other members.

Membership of an MLS group is managed at the level of individual clients.
In most cases, a client corresponds to a specific device used by a user. If a
user has multiple devices, the user will be represented in a group by multiple
clients.  If an application wishes to implement operations at the level of
users, it is up to the application to track which clients belong to a given user
and ensure that they are added / removed consistently.

MLS provides two mechanisms for changing the membership of a group.  The primary
mechanism is for an authorized member of the group to send a Commit that adds or
removes other members.  The second mechanism is an "external join": A member of
the group publishes certain information about the group, which a new member can
use to construct an "external" Commit message that adds the new member to the
group.  (There is no similarly unilateral way for a member to leave the group;
they must be removed by a remaining member.)

With both mechanisms, changes to the membership are initiated from inside the
group.  When members perform changes directly, this is clearly the case.
External joins are authorized indirectly, in the sense that a member publishing
a GroupInfo object authorizes anyone to join who has access to the GroupInfo
object.  External joins do not allow for more granular authorization checks to
be done before the new member is added to the group, so if an application wishes
to both allow external joins and enforce such checks, then the application will
need to do such checks when a member joins, and remove them if checks fail.

Application setup may also determine other criteria for
membership validity. For example, per-device signature keys can be signed by an
identity key recognized by other participants. If a certificate chain is
used to sign off on device signature keys, then revocation by the owner
adds an alternative flag to prompt membership removal.

An MLS group's secrets change on every change of membership, so each client only
has access to the secrets used by the group while they are a member.  Messages
sent before a client joins or after they are removed are protected with keys
that are not accessible to the client.  Compromise of a member removed from a
group does not affect the security of messages sent after their removal.
Messages sent during the client's membership are also secure as long as the
client has properly implemented the MLS deletion schedule.

## Parallel Groups

Any user or client may have membership in several groups simultaneously.
The set of members of any group may or may not form a subset of the
members of another group. MLS guarantees that the FS and PCS goals
within a given group are maintained and not weakened by user membership
in multiple groups. However, actions in other groups likewise do not strengthen
the FS and PCS guarantees within a given group, e.g. key updates within a
given group following a device compromise does not provide PCS healing in
other groups; each group must be updated separately to achieve internal goals.
This also applies to future groups that a member has yet to join, that are likewise
unaffected by updates performed in current groups.

Applications may strengthen connectivity among parallel groups by
requiring periodic key updates from a user across all groups in which they have
membership.

Applications may use the PSK mechanism to link healing properties among parallel
groups.  For example, suppose a common member M of two groups A and B has
performed a key update in group A but not in group B.  The key update provides
PCS with regard to M in group A.  If a PSK is exported from group A and injected
into group B, then some of these PCS properties carry over to group B, since the
PSK and secrets derived from it are only known to the new, updated version of M,
not to the old, possibly compromised version of M.

## Asynchronous Usage

No operation in MLS requires two distinct clients or members to be
online simultaneously. In particular, members participating in
conversations protected using MLS can update the group's keys, add or
remove new members, and send messages without waiting
for another user's reply.

Messaging systems that implement MLS have to provide a transport layer
for delivering messages asynchronously and reliably.

## Access Control

The MLS protocol allows each member of the messaging group to perform
operations equally. This is because all clients within a group
(members) have access to the shared cryptographic material. However
every service/infrastructure has control over policies applied to
its own clients. Applications managing MLS clients can be configured
to allow for specific group operations. On the one hand, an application could
decide that a group
administrator will be the only member to perform add and remove
operations. On the other hand, in
many settings such as open discussion forums, joining can be allowed
for anyone.

The MLS protocol can, in certain modes, exchange unencrypted group
operation messages. This flexibility is to allow services to perform
access control tasks on behalf of the group.

While the Application messages will always be encrypted, having the
handshake messages in plaintext has inconveniences in terms of privacy
as someone could collect the signatures on the handshake messages and
use them for tracking.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Prefer using encrypted group operation messages to avoid privacy
> issues related to non-encrypted signatures.

Note that in the default case of encrypted handshake messages, any access
control policies will be applied at the client, so the
application must ensure that the access control policies are
consistent across all clients to make sure that they remain in sync.
If two different policies were applied, the clients might not accept
or reject a group operation and end-up in different cryptographic
states, breaking their ability to communicate.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Avoid using inconsistent access control policies in the case of
> encrypted group operations.

MLS allows actors outside the group to influence the group in two ways: External
signers can submit proposals for changes to the group, and new joiners can use
an external join to add themselves to the group.  The `external_senders`
extension ensures that all members agree on which signers are allowed to send
proposals, but any other policies must be assured to be consistent as above.

> ** RECOMMENDATION:**
> Have an explicit group policy setting the conditions under which external
> joins are allowed.

## Recovery After State Loss

Group members whose local MLS state is lost or corrupted can reinitialize their
state by re-joining the group as a new member and removing the member
representing their earlier state.  An application can require that a client
performing such a reinitialization prove its prior membership with a PSK.

There are a few practical challenges to this approach.  For example, the
application will need to ensure that all members have the required PSK,
including any new members that have joined the group since the epoch in which
the PSK was issued.

Reinitializing in this way does not provide the member with access to group
messages from during the state loss window, but enables proof of
prior membership in the group. Applications may choose various
configurations for providing lost messages to valid group members
that are able to prove prior membership.

## Support for Multiple Devices

It is typically expected for users within a group to own various
devices. A new device can be added to a group and be considered as
a new client by the protocol. This client will not gain access to the history
even if it is owned by someone who owns another member of the group.
Restoring history is typically not allowed at the protocol level but
applications can elect to provide such a mechanism outside of MLS.
Such mechanisms, if used, may reduce the FS and PCS guarantees
provided by MLS.

## Extensibility

The MLS protocol provides several extension points where additional information
can be provided.  Extensions to KeyPackages allow clients to disclose additional
information about their capabilities.  Groups can also have extension data
associated with them, and the group agreement properties of MLS will confirm that
all members of the group agree on the content of these extensions.

## Application Data Framing and Negotiation

Application messages carried by MLS are opaque to the protocol; they can contain
arbitrary data. Each application which uses MLS needs to define the format of its
`application_data` and any mechanism necessary to negotiate the format of that
content over the lifetime of an MLS group. In many applications this means
managing format migrations for groups with multiple members who may each be
offline at unpredictable times.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Use the default content mechanism defined in {{?I-D.mahy-mls-content-neg}},
> unless the specific application defines another mechanism which more
> appropriately addresses the same requirements for that application of MLS.

The MLS framing for application messages also provides a field where clients can
send information that is authenticated but not encrypted.  Such information can
be used by servers that handle the message, but group members are assured that
it has not been tampered with.

## Federation

The protocol aims to be compatible with federated environments. While
this document does not specify all necessary mechanisms required for
federation, multiple MLS implementations can interoperate to form
federated systems if they use compatible authentication mechanisms,
ciphersuites, and infrastructure functionalities.

## Compatibility with Future Versions of MLS

It is important that multiple versions of MLS be able to coexist in
the future. Thus, MLS offers a version negotiation mechanism; this
mechanism prevents version downgrade attacks where an attacker would
actively rewrite messages with a lower protocol version than the ones
originally offered by the endpoints. When multiple versions of MLS are
available, the negotiation protocol guarantees that the version agreed
upon will be the highest version supported in common by the group.

In MLS 1.0, the creator of the group is responsible for selecting the
best ciphersuite supported across clients. Each client is able to
verify availability of protocol version, ciphersuites and extensions
at all times once he has at least received the first group operation
message.

Each member of an MLS group advertises the protocol functionality they support.
These capability advertisements can be updated over time, e.g., if client
software is updated while the client is a member of a group. Thus, in addition
to preventing downgrade attacks, the members of a group can also observe when it
is safe to upgrade to a new ciphersuite or protocol version.

# Operational Requirements

MLS is a security layer that needs to be integrated with an application. A
fully-functional deployment of MLS will have to make a number of decisions about
how MLS is configured and operated.  Deployments that wish to interoperate will
need to make compatible decisions. This section lists all of the dependencies of
an MLS deployment that are external to the protocol specification, but would
still need to be aligned within a given MLS deployment, or for two deployments
to potentially interoperate.

The protocol has a built-in ability to negotiate protocol versions,
ciphersuites, extensions, credential types, and additional proposal types. For
two deployments to interoperate, they must have overlapping support in each of
these categories. A `required_capabilities` extension can help maintain
interoperability with a wider set of clients by ensuring that certain
functionality continues to be supported by a group, even if the clients in the
group aren't currently relying on it.

MLS relies on the following network services. These network services would
need to be compatible in order for
two different deployments based on them to interoperate.

- An **Authentication Service**, described fully in {{authentication-service}},
  defines the types of credentials which may be used in a deployment and
  provides methods for:
  1. Issuing new credentials,
  2. Validating a credential against a reference identifier, and
  3. Validating whether or not two credentials represent the same user.
- A **Delivery Service**, described fully in {{delivery-service}}, provides
  methods for:
  1. Delivering messages sent to a group to all members in the group.
  2. Delivering Welcome messages to new members of a group.
  3. Downloading KeyPackages for specific clients, and uploading new KeyPackages
     for a user's own clients.
- Additional services may or may not be required depending on the application
  design:
  - If assisted joining is desired (meaning that the ratchet tree is not
    provided in Welcome messages), there must be a method to download the
    ratchet tree corresponding to a group.
  - If assisted joining is desired and the Delivery Service is not able to
    compute the ratchet tree itself (because some proposals or commits are sent
    encrypted), there must be a method for group members to publish the updated
    ratchet tree after each commit.
  - If external joiners are allowed, there must be a method to publish a
    serialized `GroupInfo` object (with an `external_pub` extension) that
    corresponds to a specific group and epoch, and keep that object in
    sync with the state of the group.
  - If an application chooses not to allow assisted or external joining, it may
    instead provide a method for external users to solicit group members (or a
    designated service) to add them to a group.
  - If the application uses external PSKs, or uses resumption PSKs that all
    members of a group may not have access to, there must be a method for
    distributing these PSKs to group members.
  - If an application wishes to detect and possibly discipline members that send
    malformed commits with the intention of corrupting a group's state, there
    must be a method for reporting and validating malformed commits.

MLS requires the following parameters to be defined, which must be the same for
two implementations to interoperate:

- The maximum total lifetime that is acceptable for a KeyPackage.
- How long to store the resumption secret for past epochs of a group.
- The degree of tolerance that's allowed for out-of-order message delivery:
  - How long to keep unused nonce and key pairs for a sender
  - A maximum number of unused key pairs to keep.
  - A maximum number of steps that clients will move a secret tree ratchet
    forward in response to a single message before rejecting it.
  - Whether to buffer messages that aren't able to be understood yet due to
    other messages not arriving first, and if so, how many to buffer. For
    example, Commit messages that arrive before a proposal they reference, or
    application messages that arrive before the Commit starting an epoch.

MLS provides the following locations where an application may store arbitrary
data. The format and intention of any data in these locations must align for two
deployments to interoperate:

- Application data, sent as the payload of an encrypted message.
- Additional authenticated data, sent unencrypted in an otherwise encrypted
  message.
- Group IDs, as decided by group creators and used to uniquely identify a group.
- The `application_id` extension of a LeafNode.

MLS requires the following policies to be defined, which restrict the set of
acceptable behavior in a group. These policies must be consistent between
deployments for them to interoperate:

- A policy on when to send proposals and commits in plaintext instead of
  encrypted.
- A policy for which proposals are valid to have in a commit, including but not
  limited to:
  - When a member is allowed to add or remove other members of the group.
  - When, and under what circumstances, a reinitialization proposal is allowed.
  - When proposals from external senders are allowed.
  - When external joiners are allowed.
- A policy for when two credentials represent the same client. Note that many
  credentials may be issued authenticating the same identity but for different
  signature keys, because each credential corresponds to a different device
  (client) owned by the same application user. However, one device may control
  many signature keys but should still only be considered a single client.
- A policy on how long to allow a member to stay in a group without updating its
  leaf keys before removing them.

Finally, there are some additional application-defined behaviors that are
partially an individual application's decision but may overlap with
interoperability:

- If there's any policy on how or when to pad messages.
- If there is any policy for when to send a reinitialization proposal.
- How often clients should update their leaf keys.
- Whether to prefer sending full commits or partial/empty commits.
- Whether there should be a `required_capabilities` extension in groups.

# Security and Privacy Considerations

MLS adopts the Internet threat model {{?RFC3552}} and therefore
assumes that the attacker has complete control of the network. It is
intended to provide the security services described in the face of
such attackers.

- The attacker can monitor the entire network.

- The attacker can read unprotected messages.

- The attacker can generate, inject and delete any message in the unprotected
  transport layer.

In addition, these guarantees are intended to degrade gracefully in
the presence of compromise of the transport security links as well as
of both clients and elements of the messaging system, as described in
the remainder of this section.

Generally, MLS is designed under the assumption that the transport
layer is present to protect metadata and privacy in general, while the
MLS protocol is providing stronger guarantees such as confidentiality,
integrity and authentication guarantees. Stronger properties such as
deniability can also be achieved in specific architecture designs.

## Assumptions on Transport Security Links

Any secure channel can be used as a transport layer to protect MLS
messages such as QUIC, TLS, WireGuard or TOR. However, the MLS
protocol is designed to consider the following threat-model:

- The attacker can read, write, and delete arbitrary messages inside the
  secure transport channel.

This departs from most threat models where we consider that the secure
channel used for transport always provides secrecy. The reason for
this consideration is that in the group setting, active malicious
insiders or adversarial services are to be considered.

### Metadata Protection for Unencrypted Group Operations

The main use of the secure transport layer for MLS is to protect
the already limited amount of metadata. Very little information is
contained in the unencrypted header of the MLS protocol message
format for group operation messages, and application messages are
always encrypted in MLS.

MLS avoids needing to send the full list of recipients
to the server for dispatching messages because that
list is potentially extremely large in MLS. Therefore, the metadata
typically consists of a pseudo-random Group Identifier (GID), a numerical value
to determine the epoch of the group (the number of changes that have been made
to the group), and another numerical value referring to the specific key needed
to decrypt the ciphertext content.

The MLS protocol provides an authenticated "Additional Authenticated
Data" field for applications to make data available outside the
MLSCiphertext.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Use the "Additional Authenticated Data" field of the MLSCiphertext
> message instead of using other unauthenticated means of sending
> metadata throughout the infrastructure. If the data is private, the
> infrastructure should use encrypted Application messages instead.

Even though some of this metadata information does not consist of secret
payloads, in correlation with other data a network observer might be
able to reconstruct sensitive information. Using a secure channel to
transfer this information will prevent a network attacker from accessing
this MLS protocol metadata if it cannot compromise the secure channel.

More importantly, there is one specific case where having no secure
channel to exchange the MLS messages can have a serious impact on
privacy. In the case of unencrypted group operation messages,
observing the signatures of the group operation messages may lead an
adversary to extract information about the group memberships.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Never use the unencrypted mode for group operations without using a
> secure channel for the transport layer.

### DoS protection

In general we do not consider Denial of Service (DoS) resistance to be
the responsibility of the protocol. However, it should not be possible
for anyone aside from the Delivery Service to perform a trivial DoS
attack from which it is hard to recover. This can be achieved through
the secure transport layer.

In the centralized setting, DoS protection can typically be performed
by using tickets or cookies which identify users to a service for a
certain number of connections. Such a system helps in preventing
anonymous clients from sending arbitrary numbers of group operation
messages to the Delivery Service or the MLS clients.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Anonymous credentials can be used in order to help DoS attacks
> prevention, in a privacy preserving manner. Note that the privacy of
> these mechanisms has to be adjusted in accordance with the privacy
> expected from the secure transport links. (See more discussion
> further down.)

### Message Suppression and Error Correction

As noted above, MLS is designed to provide some robustness in the face of
tampering within the secure transport, i.e., tampering by the Delivery Service.
The confidentiality and authenticity properties of MLS prevent the DS reading or
writing messages.  MLS also provides a few tools for detecting message
suppression, with the caveat that message suppression cannot always be
distinguished from transport failure.

Each encrypted MLS message carries a "generation" number which is a per-sender
incrementing counter.  If a group member observes a gap in the generation
sequence for a sender, then they know that they have missed a message from that
sender.  MLS also provides a facility for group members to send authenticated
acknowledgements of application messages received within a group.

As discussed in {{delivery-service}}, the Delivery Service is trusted to select
the single Commit message that is applied in each epoch from among the ones sent
by group members.  Since only one Commit per epoch is meaningful, it's not
useful for the DS to transmit multiple Commits to clients.  The risk remains
that the DS will use the ability maliciously.

While it is difficult or impossible to prevent a network adversary from
suppressing payloads in transit, in certain infrastructures such as banks
or governments settings, unidirectional transports can be used and be
enforced via electronic or physical devices such as diodes. This can
lead to payload corruption which does not affect the security or
privacy properties of the MLS protocol but does affect the reliability
of the service. In that case specific measures can be taken to ensure
the appropriate level of redundancy and quality of service for MLS.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> If unidirectional transport is used for the secure transport
> channel, prefer using a protocol which provides Forward Error
> Correction.

## Intended Security Guarantees

MLS aims to provide a number of security guarantees, covering authentication, as
well as confidentiality guarantees to different degrees in different scenarios.

### Message Secrecy and Authentication {#message-secrecy-authentication}

MLS enforces the encryption of application messages and thus generally
guarantees authentication and confidentiality of application messages sent in a
group.

In particular, this means that only other members of a given group can decrypt
the payload of a given application message, which includes information about the
sender of the message.

Similarly, group members receiving a message from another group member can
authenticate that group member as the sender of the message and verify the
message's integrity.

Message content can be deniable if the signature keys are exchanged over a
deniable channel prior to signing messages.

Depending on the group settings, handshake messages can be encrypted as well. If
that is the case, the same security guarantees apply.

MLS optionally allows the addition of padding to messages, mitigating the amount
of information leaked about the length of the plaintext to an observer on the
network.

### Forward and Post-Compromise Security {#fs-and-pcs}

MLS provides additional protection regarding secrecy of past messages
and future messages. These cryptographic security properties are
Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS).

FS means that access to all encrypted traffic history combined with an
access to all current keying material on clients will not defeat the
secrecy properties of messages older than the oldest key of the
compromised client.
Note that this means that clients have the extremely important role of
deleting appropriate keys as soon as they have been used with the
expected message, otherwise the secrecy of the messages and the
security for MLS is considerably weakened.

PCS means that if a group member's state is compromised at some time t
but the group member subsequently performs an update at some time t',
then all MLS guarantees apply to messages sent by the member after
time t', and by other members after they have processed the
update. For example, if an attacker learns all secrets known to Alice
at time t, including both Alice's long-term secret keys and all shared
group keys, but Alice performs a key update at time t', then the
attacker is unable to violate any of the MLS security properties after
the updates have been processed.

Both of these properties are satisfied even against compromised
DSs and ASs.

### Non-Repudiation vs Deniability {#Non-Repudiation-vs-Deniability}

MLS provides strong authentication within a group, such that a group member
cannot send a message that appears to be from another group member.
Additionally, some services require that a recipient be able to prove to the
service provider that a message was sent by a given client, in order to report
abuse. MLS supports both of these use cases. In some deployments, these services
are provided by mechanisms which allow the receiver to prove a message's origin
to a third party. This is often called "non-repudiation".

Roughly speaking, "deniability" is the opposite of "non-repudiation", i.e., the
property that it is impossible to prove to a third party that a message was sent
by a given sender.  MLS does not make any claims with regard to deniability.  It
may be possible to operate MLS in ways that provide certain deniability
properties, but defining the specific requirements and resulting notions of
deniability requires further analysis.

## Endpoint Compromise

The MLS protocol adopts a threat model which includes multiple forms
of endpoint/client compromise. While adversaries are in a very strong position
if they have compromised an MLS client, there are still situations
where security guarantees can be recovered thanks to the PCS
properties achieved by the MLS protocol.

In this section we will explore the consequences and recommendations
regarding the following compromise scenarios:

- The attacker has access to a specific symmetric encryption key

- The attacker has access to the group secrets for one group

- The attacker has access to a signature oracle for any group

- The attacker has access to the signature key for one group

- The attacker has access to all secrets of a user for all groups
  (full state compromise)

Recall that the MLS protocol provides chains of AEAD keys, per sender
that are generated from Group Secrets. These keys are used to protect
MLS Plaintext messages which can be Group Operation or Application
messages. The Group Operation messages offer an additional protection
as the secret exchanged within the TreeKEM group key agreement are
public-key encrypted to subgroups with HPKE.

### Compromise of AEAD key material

In some circumstances, adversaries may have access to specific AEAD
keys and nonces which protect an Application or a Group Operation
message. While this is a very weak kind of compromise, it can be
realistic in cases of implementation vulnerabilities where only part
of the memory leaks to the adversary.

When an AEAD key is compromised, the adversary has access to a set of
AEAD keys for the same chain and the same epoch, hence can decrypt
messages sent using keys of this chain. An adversary cannot send a
message to a group which appears to be from any valid client since
they cannot forge the signature.

The MLS protocol will ensure that an adversary cannot compute any
previous AEAD keys for the same epoch, or any other epochs.  Because
of its Forward Secrecy guarantees, MLS will also retain secrecy of all
other AEAD keys generated for *other* MLS clients, outside this
dedicated chain of AEAD keys and nonces, even within the epoch of the
compromise. However the MLS protocol does not provide Post Compromise
Secrecy for AEAD encryption within an epoch. This means that if the
AEAD key of a chain is compromised, the adversary can compute an
arbitrary number of subsequent AEAD keys for that chain.

These guarantees are ensured by the structure of the MLS key schedule
which provides Forward Secrecy for these AEAD encryptions, across the
messages within the epoch and also across previous epochs.  Those
chains are completely disjoint and compromising keys across the
chains would mean that some Group Secrets have been compromised, which
is not the case in this attack scenario (we explore stronger
compromise scenarios as part of the following sections).

MLS provides Post-Compromise Secrecy against an active adaptive
attacker across epochs for AEAD encryption, which means that as soon
as the epoch is changed, if the attacker does not have access to more
secret material they won't be able to access any protected messages
from future epochs.

In the case of an Application message, an AEAD key compromise means
that the encrypted application message will be leaked as well as the
signature over that message. This means that the compromise has both
confidentiality and privacy implications on the future AEAD
encryptions of that chain.
In the case of a Group Operation message, only the privacy is
affected, as the signature is revealed, because the secrets themselves
are protected by HPKE encryption.

Note that under that compromise scenario, authentication is not
affected in neither of these cases.  As every member of the group can
compute the AEAD keys for all the chains (they have access to the
Group Secrets) in order to send and receive messages, the
authentication provided by the AEAD encryption layer of the common
framing mechanism is very weak. Successful decryption of an AEAD
encrypted message only guarantees that a member of the group sent the
message.

### Compromise of the Group Secrets of a single group for one or more group epochs

The attack scenario considering an adversary gaining access to a set
of Group secrets is significantly stronger. This can typically be the
case when a member of the group is compromised.
For this scenario, we consider that the signature keys are not
compromised. This can be the case for instance if the adversary has
access to part of the memory containing the group secrets but not to
the signature keys which might be stored in a secure enclave.

In this scenario, the adversary gains the ability to compute any
number of AEAD encryption keys for any AEAD chains and can encrypt and
decrypt all messages for the compromised epochs.

If the adversary is passive, it is expected from the PCS properties of
the MLS protocol that, as soon as an honest Commit message is sent by
the compromised party, the next epochs will provide message secrecy.

If the adversary is active, the adversary can follow the protocol and
perform updates on behalf of the compromised party with no ability to
an honest group to recover message secrecy. However, MLS provides PCS
against active adaptive attackers through its Remove group
operation. This means that, as long as other members of the group are
honest, the protocol will guarantee message secrecy for all messages
exchanged in the epochs after the compromised party has been removed.

### Compromise by an active adversary with the ability to sign messages

Under such a scenario, where an active adversary has compromised an
MLS client, two different settings emerge. In the strongest compromise
scenario, the attacker has access to the signing key and can forge
authenticated messages. In a weaker, yet realistic scenario, the
attacker has compromised a client but the client signature keys are
protected with dedicated hardware features which do not allow direct
access to the value of the private key and instead provide a signature
API.

When considering an active adaptive attacker with access to a
signature oracle, the compromise scenario implies a significant
impact on both the secrecy and authentication guarantees of the
protocol, especially if the attacker also has access to the group
secrets. In that case both secrecy and authentication are broken.
The attacker can generate any message, for the current and future
epochs until an honest update from the compromised client happens.

Note that under this compromise scenario, the attacker can perform all
operations which are available to an legitimate client even without
access to the actual value of the signature key.

Without access to the group secrets, the adversary will not have the
ability to generate messages which look valid to other members of the
group and to the infrastructure as they need to have access to group
secrets to compute the encryption keys or the membership tag.

### Compromise of the authentication with access to a signature key

The difference between having access to the value of the signature key
and only having access to a signing oracle is not about the ability of
an active adaptive network attacker to perform different operations
during the time of the compromise, the attacker can perform every
operation available to a legitimate client in both cases.

There is a significant difference, however in terms of recovery after
a compromise.

Because of the PCS guarantees provided by the MLS protocol, when a
previously compromised client performs an honest Commit which is not
under the control of the adversary, both secrecy and authentication of
messages can be recovered in the case where the attacker didn't get
access to the key. Because the adversary doesn't have the key and has
lost the ability to sign messages, they cannot authenticate messages
on behalf of the compromised party, even if they still have control
over some group keys by colluding with other members of the group.

This is in contrast with the case where the signature key is leaked.
In that case PCS of the MLS protocol will eventually allow recovery of
the authentication of messages for future epochs but only after
compromised parties refresh their credentials securely.

Beware that in both oracle and private key access, an active
adaptive attacker, can follow the protocol and request to update its
own credential. This in turn induces a signature key rotation which
could provide the attacker with part or the full value of the private
key depending on the architecture of the service provider.

> Signature private keys should be compartmentalized from other
> secrets and preferably protected by an HSM or dedicated hardware
> features to allow recovery of the authentication for future messages
> after a compromise.

### Security consideration in the context of a full state compromise

In real-world compromise scenarios, it is often the case that
adversaries target specific devices to obtain parts of the memory or
even the ability to execute arbitrary code in the targeted device.

Also, recall that in this setting, the application will often retain
the unencrypted messages. If so, the adversary does not have to break
encryption at all to access sent and received messages. Messages may
also be sent by using the application to instruct the protocol
implementation.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> If messages are stored on the device, they should be protected using
> encryption at rest, and the keys used should be stored
> securely using dedicated mechanisms on the device.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> If the threat model of the system is against an adversary which can
> access the messages on the device without even needing to attack
> MLS, the application should delete plaintext messages and
> ciphertexts immediately after encryption or decryption.

Even though, from the strict point of view of the security
formalization, a ciphertext is always public and will forever be,
there is no loss in trying to erase ciphertexts as much as possible.

Note that this document makes a clear distinction between the way
signature keys and other group shared secrets must be handled.
In particular, a large set of group secrets cannot necessarily be assumed
to be protected by an HSM or secure enclave features. This is
especially true because these keys are extremely frequently used and
changed with each message received by a client.

However, the signature private keys are mostly used by clients to send
a message. They also are providing the strong authentication
guarantees to other clients, hence we consider that their protection
by additional security mechanism should be a priority.

Overall there is no way to detect or prevent these compromise, as
discussed in the previous sections, performing separation of the
application secret states can help recovery after compromise, this is
the case for signature keys but similar concern exists for the
encryption private key used in the TreeKEM Group Key Agreement.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> The secret keys used for public key encryption should be stored
> similarly to the way the signature keys are stored, as keys can be
> used to decrypt the group operation messages and contain the secret
> material used to compute all the group secrets.

Even if secure enclaves are not perfectly secure, or even completely
broken, adopting additional protections for these keys can ease
recovery of the secrecy and authentication guarantees after a
compromise where, for instance, an attacker can sign messages without
having access to the key. In certain contexts, the rotation of
credentials might only be triggered by the AS through ACLs, hence be
outside of the capabilities of the attacker.

## Service Node Compromise

### General considerations

#### Privacy of the network connections

There are many scenarios leading to communication between the
application on a device and the Delivery Service or the Authentication
Service. In particular when:

- The application connects to the Authentication Service to generate
  or validate a new credential before distributing it.

- The application fetches credentials at the Delivery Service prior to
  creating a messaging group (one-to-one or more than two clients).

- The application fetches service provider information or messages on
  the Delivery Service.

- The application sends service provider information or messages to
  the Delivery Service.

In all these cases, the application will often connect to the device
via a secure transport which leaks information about the origin of the
request such as the IP address and depending on the protocol the MAC
address of the device.

Similar concerns exist in the peer-to-peer use cases of MLS.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> In the case where privacy or anonymity is important, using adequate
> protection such as TOR or a VPN can improve metadata protection.

More generally, using anonymous credentials in an MLS based
architecture might not be enough to provide strong privacy or
anonymity properties.

### Delivery Service Compromise

MLS is intended to provide strong guarantees in the face of compromise
of the DS. Even a totally compromised DS should not be able to read
messages or inject messages that will be acceptable to legitimate
clients. It should also not be able to undetectably remove, reorder
or replay messages.

However, a DS can mount a variety of DoS attacks on the system,
including total DoS attacks (where it simply refuses to forward any
messages) and partial DoS attacks (where it refuses to forward
messages to and from specific clients).
As noted in {{delivery-guarantees}}, these attacks are only partially
detectable by clients without an out-of-band channel. Ultimately,
failure of the DS to provide reasonable service must be dealt with as
a customer service matter, not via technology.

Because the DS is responsible for providing the initial keying
material to clients, it can provide stale keys. This does not
inherently lead to compromise of the message stream, but does allow it
to attack forward security to a limited extent. This threat can be
mitigated by having initial keys expire.

#### Privacy of delivery and push notifications

An important mechanism that is often ignored from the privacy
considerations are the push-tokens. In many modern messaging
architectures, applications are using push notification mechanisms
typically provided by OS vendors. This is to make sure that when
messages are available at the Delivery Service (or by other mechanisms
if the DS is not a central server), the recipient application on a
device knows about it. Sometimes the push notification can contain the
application message itself which saves a round trip with the DS.

To "push" this information to the device, the service provider and the
OS infrastructures use unique per-device, per-application identifiers
called push-tokens. This means that the push notification provider and
the service provider have information on which devices receive
information and at which point in time.

Even though they can't necessarily access the content, which is
typically encrypted MLS messages, the service provider and the push
notification provider have to be trusted to avoid making correlation
on which devices are recipients of the same message.

For secure messaging systems, push notification are often sent
real-time as it is not acceptable to create artificial delays for
message retrieval.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> If real time notifications are not necessary and that specific steps
> must be taken to improve privacy, one can delay notifications
> randomly across recipient devices using a mixnet or other
> techniques.

Note that it is quite easy for legal requests to ask the service
provider for the push-token associated to an identifier and perform a
second request to the company operating the push-notification system
to get information about the device, which is often linked with a real
identity via a cloud account, a credit card or other information.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> If stronger privacy guarantees are needed vis-a-vis the push
> notification provider, the client can choose to periodically connect
> to the Delivery Service without the need of a dedicated push
> notification infrastructure.

### Authentication Service Compromise {#as-compromise}

The Authentication Service design is left to the infrastructure
designers. In most designs, a compromised AS is a serious matter, as
the AS can serve incorrect or attacker-provided identities to clients.

- The attacker can link an identity to a credential

- The attacker can generate new credentials

- The attacker can sign new credentials

- The attacker can publish or distribute credentials

Infrastructures that provide cryptographic material or credentials in
place of the MLS client (which is under the control of the user) have
often the ability to use the associated secrets to perform operations
on behalf of the user, which is unacceptable in many situations. Other
mechanisms can be used to prevent this issue, such as the service
blessing cryptographic material used by an MLS client.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Make clients submit signature public keys to the AS, this is usually
> better than the AS generating public key pairs because the AS
> cannot sign on behalf of the client. This is a benefit of a Public
> Key Infrastructure in the style of the Internet PKI.

An attacker that can generate or sign new credentials may or may not
have access to the underlying cryptographic material necessary to
perform such operations. In that last case, it results in windows of
time for which all emitted credentials might be compromised.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Using HSMs to store the root signature keys to limit the ability of
> an adversary with no physical access to extract the top-level
> signature key.

#### Authentication compromise: Ghost users and impersonations

One thing for which the MLS Protocol is designed for is to make sure
that all clients know who is in the group at all times. This means
that - if all Members of the group and the Authentication Service are
honest - no other parties than the members of the current group can
read and write messages protected by the protocol for that Group.

Beware though, the link between the cryptographic identity of the
Client and the real identity of the User is important.
With some Authentication Service designs, a private or centralized
authority can be trusted to generate or validate signature keypairs
used in the MLS protocol. This is typically the case in some of the
biggest messaging infrastructures.

While this service is often very well protected from external
attackers, it might be the case that this service is compromised.
In such infrastructure, the AS could generate or validate a signature
keypair for an identity which is not the expected one. Because a user
can have many MLS clients running the MLS protocol, it possibly has
many signature keypairs for multiple devices.

In the case where an adversarial keypair is generated for a specific
identity, an infrastructure without any transparency mechanism or
out-of-band authentication mechanism could inject a malicious client
into a group by impersonating a user. This is especially the case in
large groups where the UI might not reflect all the changes back to

While the ways to handle MLS credentials are not defined by the
protocol or the architecture documents, the MLS protocol has been
designed with a mechanism that can be used to provide out-of-band
authentication to users. The "authentication_secret" generated for
each user at each epoch of the group is a one-time, per client,
authentication secret which can be exchanged between users to prove
their identity to each other. This can be done for instance using a QR
code that can be scanned by the other parties.

Another way to improve the security for the users is to provide a
transparency mechanism which allows each user to check if credentials
used in groups have been published in the transparency log. Another
benefit of this mechanism is for revocation. The users of a group
could check for revoked keys (in case of compromise detection) using a
mechanism such as CRLite or some more advanced privacy preserving
technology.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Provide a Key Transparency and Out-of-Band authentication mechanisms
> to limit the impact of an Authentication Service compromise.

We note, again, that as described prior to that section, the
Authentication Service is facultative to design a working
infrastructure and can be replaced by many mechanisms such as
establishing prior one-to-one deniable channels, gossiping, or using
TOFU for credentials used by the MLS Protocol.

Another important consideration is the ease of redistributing new keys
on client compromise, which helps recovering security faster in
various cases.

#### Privacy of the Group Membership

Often, expectation from users is that the infrastructure will not
retain the ability to constantly map the user identity to signature
public keys of the MLS protocol. Some infrastructures will keep a
mapping between signature public keys of clients and user
identities. This can benefit an adversary that has compromised the AS
(or required access according to regulation) the ability of monitoring
unencrypted traffic and correlating the messages exchanged within the
same group.

> Always use encrypted group operation messages to reduce issues
> related to privacy.

In certain cases, the adversary can access specific bindings
between public keys and identities. If the signature keys are reused
across groups, the adversary can get more information about the
targeted user.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Do not use the same signature keypair across groups.

> Separate the service binding the identities and the public keys from

## Considerations for attacks outside of the threat model

Physical attacks on devices storing and executing MLS principals are
not considered in depth in the threat model of the MLS protocol.
While non-permanent, non-invasive attacks can sometimes be equivalent
to software attacks, physical attacks are considered outside of the
MLS threat model.

Compromise scenarios typically consist in a software adversary, which
can maintain active adaptive compromise and arbitrarily change the
behavior of the client or service.

On the other hand, security goals consider that honest clients will
always run the protocol according to its specification. This relies on
implementations of the protocol to securely implement the
specification, which remains non-trivial.

> **RECOMMENDATION:**
> Additional steps should be taken to protect the device and the MLS
> clients from physical compromise. In such settings, HSMs and secure
> enclaves can be used to protect signature keys.

## Cryptographic Analysis of the MLS Protocol

Various academic works have analyzed MLS and the different security guarantees
it aims to provide. The security of large parts of the protocol has been
analyzed by [BBN19] (draft 7), [ACDT21] (draft 11) and [AJM20] (draft 12).

Individual components of various drafts of the MLS protocol have been analyzed in
isolation and with differing adversarial models, for example, [BBR18], [ACDT19],
[ACCKKMPPWY19], [AJM20] and [ACJM20] analyze the ratcheting tree as the
sub-protocol of MLS that facilitates key agreement, while [BCK21] analyzes the
key derivation paths in the ratchet tree and key schedule. Finally, [CHK19]
analyzes the authentication and cross-group healing guarantees provided by MLS.
